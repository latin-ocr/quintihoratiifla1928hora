SATIRE V.

This satire contains Horace’s celebrated account of a jour-
ney to Brundusium. His adventures are recounted with much
pleasantry3 and the satire is considered one of his best per-
formances. Horace accompanied Maecenas, Cocceius, and Ca-
pito to Brundusium on business of a politica] nature. 1 t was on
this occasion that the reconciliation was effected between Au·
gustus and Antony, and the treaty of peace made, by which Oc-
tavia was given in marriage to Antony.
