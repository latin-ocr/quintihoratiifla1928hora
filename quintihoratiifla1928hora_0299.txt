been shed on his mind, he would not have considered the short-
ness of life as a reason only for enjoying it as it passed ; which
is indeed good philosophy3 but he would have urged the ne-
cessity also of forming the character for a higher and a nobler
existence. ⁴

Who the person was, that is here addressed by the name of
Posthumus (or Posuimus, as some say it should be written),
has not been ascertained. But it appears to have been a friend
whom Horace considered too parsimonious, and advises to a
more liberal enjoyment of his fortune.

5. Non, si . . . euavigandd -· the construction is, Non afferet
moram, amice, si quotquot dies eunt, places illacrymabilem Pluto-
na trecenis tauris‚· Plutona qui compescit ter amplum Geryonen
Tityonque tristi undd, scilicet enavigandci omnibus quicunque
vescimur munere term.

23. Invisus .· ‘ forbidding,' ‘mournful.' The cypress was sacred
to Pluto and Proserpine, and it was usually placed on the fune-

ODE XII.

In this ode Horace contrasts the magnificence of the Ro-
mans of his time, in their buildings, plantations, gardenS, and
pleasure grounds, with the frugality of their ancestors3 who
considered the public edifices, and the temples of the gods, the
noblest monuments of real grandeur, as well as of piety.

1. Jam: ‘ shortly,’ ‘soon.'—Regioe moles .- ‘ the princely edi·
fices?

4. Stagna.- ‘ fish-ponds.’ By these the poet probably means
large portions of salt water inclosed from the sea by artificial
piers and dykes.—Platanus: the plane tree was planted for
ornament only: whereas the elm was considered very useful
for the vines to run upon.

6. Et om’nis . . . narium : ‘ and the whole tribe of sweet-scent-
ed flowers.
tlh& Fertilib'us . . . priori -· ‘ which were formerly profitable to

e1r owner.

9. Tum: ‘soon’; i. e. the laurel will be made to grow so
thick, for the comfort of those walking, that the rays of the sun
will be excluded from the ground.

13. Privatus . . . brevis : ‘then private fortunes were small)
—lllis .· sc. auspiciis or temporibus.

14. Nulla . . . Arcton: i. e. no piazza of private individuals
was so constructed as to intercept the cool north wind, and
keep it from others.

17. Ρονιαὶἰτὲἑι . . . cespitem .· ‘ any land distributed by loti’
