314 NOTES.

rius and Drusus over the Rhaeti and Vindelici. His return was
expected with much impatience at Rome, where a magnificent
triumph was preparing for him. On this occasion Antonius Ju-
lius, then praetor of the city, requested Horace to write a Pinda-
ric ode in honour of Augustus. Our poet confesses himself un-
equal to the task, and tells Antonius that he can much better
perform it himself 3 while at the same time, as his Commentators
say, he surpassed even Pindar.

3. Daturus nomina .· it will be recollected that Icarus, the
son of Daedalus, is said to have given a name to the Icarian
Sea by being drowned in it. He fiew too high, and the sun
melted the wax with which his wings were constructed, and he
fell into that part of the Archipelago which bears his name.

7. Profundo . . . ore: i. e. with deep and majestic eloquence.

10. Nova . . . verba.- although writers of dithyrambic poetry
were not restrained by the ordinary laws of number and mea-
sure, and gave way to a daring irregularity not allowed to any
other form of writing3 yet they had no right to coin ‘new
words.' But they made new combinations, and nova verba
probably means compound words, not so used before.

13. Regesve . . . sanguinem : ‘or celebrates those princely he-
roes3' i. e. Theseus, Pirithous, Bellerophon, and others. See
Class. Dict-

17. Elea . . . palma .· i. e. the crown won at the Olympio
games at Elis.

19. Centum . . . munere: i. e. ‘⁶ carmine centum statuis prae-
ferendo.” Doer.

22. Vires animumque moresque : ‘ bodily strength, courage,
and moral virtues?

25. Multa . . . tractus.- ‘whenever Pindar rises to the losty
regions of the clouds, a strong and even breeze supports that
Dircaean swan.’ Dirce, is a fountain in Boeotia, near Thebes,
where Pindar was born.

33. Concines: i. e. tu poeta, Ο Antoni, εαπεε.

35. Per sacrum clivum: this alludes to the manner in which
a victorious general in a triumph led the captive princes in the
procession to the Capitol, which was situated on a hill.

49. Tuque .· The tu must not be referred to sol, nor to
triumphe, as some have supposed, but to Antonius, as the whole
drist of the sentence implies. For as he married the emperor's
niece, he would of course be near his chariot in the procession.

52. Dicemus: sc. nOS, ego et omnis civitas. We will often
shout, Io triumphe. This was the usual exclamation on such
occasions.

53. Te : this also, of course, refers to Antonius, who, being of
high rank, must offer a sacrifice os corresponding magnificence‚
while a trifling one would suffice the humble bard-

57. curvatos . . . ignes .- i. e. resembling the bright crescent
of the moon when three days old.
