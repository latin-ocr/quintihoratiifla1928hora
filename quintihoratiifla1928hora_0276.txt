256 NOTES.

show, that true wisdom consists in doing our duty and enjoying
present blessings, without troubling ourselves about what is
beyond our power to know. f

1. Tu ne quaesieris : ‘ do not attempt to discover.' 2
s 2. Nec Babylonios . . . numeros: ‘nor try the Babylonian
numbers) The Chaldeans were famous for their skill in mathe-
matics, and particularly in astronomy. And some of them pre-
tended that they could foretell, by their knowledge of the stars,
the fortunes of any one, the time of whose nativity was given ’
them. Their influence became so baneful and mischieVOUS‚ that
they were banished from Italy by a formal decree.

They had a set of tables for casting nativities, which Horace
terms Babylonios tentare numeros.

5. Quae . . . Tyrrhenum: ‘which now dashes the waves of
the Tuscan sea against the rocky shores? By pumicibus we
may understand the rocks corroded and worn away, so as to re-
semble pumice stones.—Debilitat: ‘weakens, or e‘xhausts the fu-
ry of,' by dashipg against the rocks.

6. Diques .· The ancients used to filtrate their wine, to ren-
derit more pure and delicate.

7. Reseces : ‘ forbear to indulge)

ODE XI.

This ode has been called by some a hymn to Jupiter. The
principal object, however, seems to have been the exaltation of
Augustus, which is most effectually accomplished, though indi-
rectly, by blending his praises with those of the gods and of
deified heroes.

Dion, Book XV, says, that, after the victory at Actium, in
which Cleopatra, Mark Antony, and the Egyptian fleet were
defeated, it was decreed by the senate, that mention of Augus-
tus should be made in their solemn hymns, as well as of
the immortal gods. This may account for the peculiarity of

thlj. oldris-rgo: i. e. echo, the ‘image ’ of the voice.

7. Unde: ‘from which mountain.’-—vocalem: ‘while sing-
‘ 9
mgis. Quid pras . . . laudibus.- ‘what shall 1 celebrate before
the wonted praises of Jupiter, parent of all P ’

16. Horis: ‘ seasons.’

18. Simile aut secundum .· ‘ equal or second in glory.' Ι

19. Proximos: although no one should hold the second
or third place, yet whoever filled the fourth place would
be next to him who held the first. So Pallas, however
sar removed from Jove, holds precedence of the other di-
vinities.

22. Virgo : Diana, the huntress.

26. Hunc: Castor.-]llum.· Pollux.

31. Volue're : i. e. Castor and Pollux.
