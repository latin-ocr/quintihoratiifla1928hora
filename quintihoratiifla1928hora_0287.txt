ODES. BOOK Ι. 277

10. Dives . . . impune} .- the construction is, et dives mercator,
carus dis ipsis, quippe ter et quater anno impune revisens Atlan-
ticum aequor, exsiccet vina aureis culullis, reparata Syrti merce.

17. Frui paratis . . . mente : ‘ grant, Ο son of Latona, Ι pray
you, that Ι may enjoy the blessings already acquired, both in
health and with a mind unimpaired.’—-Paratis, i. e. what I
now possess—Lato& : voc. of Latous. The same sentiment as in
Juvenal x, 356 ; Orandmn est, ut sit mens sana in corpore sano.

ODE XXVII.

It seems that, on some occasion of more than ordinary im·
portance, Horace was requested to write 3 whether by Augus-
tus, Maecenas, or some other person, it does not appear. But
the poet addresses his lyre in a manner calculated to show that
he feels the responsibility of the undertaking.

1. Poscimur: ‘our efforts are demanded 3’ i. e. I am put in
requisition, my services are required3 and if when at ease I
have ever sung with you any thing deserving to live for a year
or more—come now, O my lyre, first tuned by Lesbian Alcaeus,
and prompt a Latin song in your wonted measure.

3. Latinum : meaning that the same lyre had before respond-
ed in Greek.

6. Qui ferox bello.- Alcaeus was no less distinguished as a
general, than as a poet. Horace evidently aspires to the same
rank as a lyric poet, among the Romans, that Alcaeus held
among the Greeks.

11. Lycum .- Lycus was a beautiful youth, beloved and cele-
brated by Alcaeus.

15. Mihi . . . rite vocanti.- ‘be propitious to me whenever,
with a proper spirit, I inyoke thine aid.’—C⁷unque,· for quaudo-
cunque.

ODE XXVIII.

Horace was a lover of pleasure‚ and had early imbibed the
doctrines of Epicurus, which favoured his propensities. But in
this ode he acknowledges his error in living, as he had, a life of
sensuality, and in neglecting the duties of religion and the
worship of the gods. Some have doubted his sincerity. Be
that as it may, he rejects the folly of the Epicureans, who deny
an overruling power, and account for all the phenomena of na-
ture independently of any such power.

2. Insanientis . . . erro. ‘while imbued with the principles
of mad philosophy Ι wander from the way.’

5. Namque Diespiter .· the poet gives a reason for disbeliev-
ing the Epicureans: I lately heard Jove thundering in a se-
rene and cloudless sky whereas thunder usually, plerumque,
