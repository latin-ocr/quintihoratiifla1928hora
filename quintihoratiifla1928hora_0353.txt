Οῗὶῐὲῗῗῑῗέἱῗ.. . . amico : ‘ nor shall I ever, while in my right mind,
compare any thing to a pleasant friend!

45. Campano ponti .· ‘ to the Campanian bridge‚’ over the

46. Parochi: sc. proebuerunt5 parochi were commissionem

55. Sarmenti. . . exstat: ‘the mistress of Sarmentus is yet
living’3 i. e. he is a runaway slave.

63. Pastorem . . . Cyclopa .· ‘ that he would personate the Cy-
clops in a danoe.’ Messius seemed well calculated for this
character, as a deep soar in the forehead gave him the look of
Polyphemus5 and he could represent him without mask or
buskins.

65. Catenam .· slaves of the meanest class were chained3 and
when freed they consecrated their chains to Saturn. But Sar-
mentus, who had run away, is supposed to have consecrated
his chains to the Lar-ea, who were invoked by travellers.

84. Venit.- ‘is sold.’

85. 1ἱξίίνὰᾶ i. e. the traveller carried this bread along with

93. Lybinphis iratis exstructa : there are two meanings to this
expression 3 one, that the town was built in despite of the en·
raged waters 3 and the other, that its inhabitants were luna.-
tics and visionaries. Francis has expressed it thus:

“ Then water-curs’d Egnatia gave us joke,
And laughter great, to hear the moon-struck folk
Assert, if incense on their altars lay,
Without the help of fire it melts away.’'

96. Jadaeus Appellat ‘the Jew Apella.'

97. Deos .· the Epicureans believed that the gods did not
