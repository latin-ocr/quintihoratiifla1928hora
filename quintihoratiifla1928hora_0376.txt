366 NOTES.

EPISTLE ΙΙ.

Horace, having in his retirement read Homer with unusual -
care and attention, writes to his friend Lollius at Rome his re-
flections on this great poet. He avails himself of the occasion,
while speaking of the morals contained in the poem, to set
forth the worth and importance of wisdom and virtue.

2. Declamas ε i. e. dicendi arte exerceris.

7. Barbariae .· i. e. sor Helen, a foreigner.

31. Ad strepitum . . . curam: ‘ and by the sound of the harp

to lull their cares to sleep.’ Cessatum, for which there are va· .

a

EPISTLE ΙΙΙ.

In the year of Rome 731 Tiberius was sent with an army
into Dalmatia. Julius Florus, to whom this epistle is addressed,
attended him in this expedition. Tiberius continued regulating

affairs in the East‚ till he was ordered by Augustus into Arme- ¹

nia. It was at this time that Horace wrote this epistle to Flo-
rus, describing the route of Tiberius through Thrace, and re-
questing to be informed on various subjeets of public and pri-
‚vate nature. He also advises Florus to be on good terms with
Munatius, between whom there had been some misunderstand-
ιι] .

brary-in the temple dedicated to Apollo on mount Palatine.

30. Sz· tibi . . . „Munatius .· ‘ if you have as much regard for

EPISTLE IV.

The poet Tibullus, to whom this ode was addressed‚ was a
Roman knight 'ot' fortune, taste, and elegance. He espoused
the cmi'se ¹of libertv with Brutus, and had suffered in his estate
. in consequence; as his lande were among those confiscated.
Four books of elegies are all that remain of his works. These
for sweetness and pathos are hardly surpassed by any thing in
the lauguage. ¹

3. Cossi Parmensis.- ‘Cassius of Parma.’ He valued himself
‘on the fertility of his genius3 and regarded the number of verses
he could write in a given time, rather than their excellence.
This is raillcry in Horace.
