ODEs. Boon 1.· 267

38. Superante Poeno .· i. e. when Hannibal, the Carthaginian,
was victorious at Cannae.

41. Hunc . . . utilem : ‘ this Fabricius, and Curius Dentatus,
with hair uncombed, a valiant warrior.’ Curius disdained the
’ refinements of polished society, as marks of effeminacy. ,

43. Apio . . . cum lare: ‘with a house proportioned to his
farm.' It was a common remark of Curius, that he was a bad
citizen, who was not contented with seven acres of land.

46. ⁸Marcelli .· this was probably that Marcellus who was five
times consul, and who first taught the Romans that Hannibal
was not invincible. The poet’s meaning is, that the glory of
the ancient Marcellus, far from being tarnished by the lapse of
time, gains new lustre in one of his descendants (i. e. the
nephew of Augustus), and, as a young shoot from an old stock,
it rises by insensible degrees to its full strength and proportions.

47. Iulium sidus .· This undoubtedly refers to the young
Marcellus, then scarce seventeen years old, whose bright and
opening virtues already reflected glory on the Julian family3
and not, as some have supposed, to Julius Caesar. This young
Marcellus, it will be recollected, was ‚the son of Octavia, the
sister of Augustus, who had adopted him as his successor3 and
the youth to whom Virgil applied those beautiful and touching
lines in AEn. vi. 882, 886. Doering thus explains it: “inter
omnes, sc. alios Romanorum juvenes. Julium sidus.- juvenis
MarcelluS, sideris instar virtutum suarum splendore gentem
suam J uliam illustrans, spes ac decus gentis Juliae.”

50. Tibi cura . . . regnes .· ‘ to yon, O Jove, has the guidance
of great Augustus been committed by the fates: so reign, I
beseech you, that his empire may be second to yours.’ That
is, as expressed in verses 57 and 58, may you rule in heaven
and he upon the earth.

f55. SEubjec’tos Orientis orae .· ‘ dwelling in the extreme bordei-s
0 the ast.

56. Seras et Indos : ‘the Serae and Indians,’ the most remote
nations of Asia.

ODE XII.

WVhen the RomanS, aster all their sufferings and privations
by the civil wars, were nevertheless concerting measures for a
renewal of them, Horace addi-esses them, or rather the com-
monwealth, under the figure of a vessel, which, although shat-
tered and dismantled, was preparing to trust itself again to
an unknown and dangerous sea. The allegory is continued
with much force and beauty throughout the ode, by which he
endeavours to dissuade his fellow citizens from their dangerous
enterprise‚ and to induce them to make sure of the blessings of
peace which were offered under the government of Augustus.

1. Novi fluctus.- i. e. ‘ new waves ’ of civil dissension.
