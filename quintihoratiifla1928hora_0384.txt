EPISTLE XIX.

This epistle is a satire on the poets of our author’s time,
who, under pretence that Bacchus was the god of poetry, and
that the best ancient bards loved wine, imagined they might
equal their merit by drinking as freely. Horace laughs at
such ridiculous imitation, and rallies the methodica] dulness of
their compositione. Dacier.

1. Cratino .· Cratinus was excessively fond of wine 3 so much
so, that Aristophanes says, he died of grief at seeing a hogshead
broken and the wine running out.

5. Fere: i. e. plerumque.

8. Forum . . . severis .· ‘ let the Forum and the praetor³s
court, established by Libo, be the lot of the sober-3 but Ι forbid
them to attempt poetry ' ; i. e. let serious business be performed
by the temperate. The praetor’s court was near the puteal.
This we understand to be the decree of Bacchus.

15. Rupit Iarbitam .· the poet means to say that Iarbita
burst with envy and uexation in attempting to rival the wit and
eloquence of Timagenes the rhetorician.

18. Cuminum .- DioscorIdes says that cumin will make per-
sons pale who wash in, or drink, a decoction of it.

40. Pulpita .- this refers to the stage, on which teachers
(grammaticen tribus) caused their pupils to recite the poems of
such writers as they were pleased with, or wished to bring into
notice. Horace says he did not court their favour, and they
resented it by slighting his writings.

43. Ait: sc. aliquis e tribu grammatica.

44. Fidis enim: ‘ for you suppose.’

47. Displicet . . . posco .· ‘ I do not like the place of contest, I
ask for a truce.’ Horace pretends very modestly to ask for
time to correct his verses, before they were brought before the

public on the stage.

EPISTLE XX.

fixes this little address to his book, in which he warns it of the
ill treatment it must expect on going out into the world. He
pleasantly adds some peculiarities of his own character.
