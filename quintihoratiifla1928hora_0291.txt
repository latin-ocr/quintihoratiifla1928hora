ODE Ι.

Asrxms Ponmo, a soldier, a statesman, and a scholar, had
also distinguished himself as a Tragic writer ; and had raised the
reputation of the Roman stage nearly to an equality with that
of Athens. But Pollio was engaged in a work better deserving
his whole strength and attention. This was a history of the
civil wars, in which he had already advanced considerably,
when Horace, apprehensive that the applause which Pollio re-
ceived from the stage might interrupt a history so interesting to
the republic, wrote this ode to urge him to persevere. And at
the same time he exhorts Pollio not to be diverted from this
object, he reminds him how delicate and (langerous a task hc

had undertaken.
1. Motum esc Metam.- the construction is, O Pollio, tractas

civicum motum ea: consule „Metello, causasque belli, διο.

It was during the consulship of Metellus and Lucius Asta-
nius, that Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus formed that confede-

The poet says, You treat of the civil commotioris which took

place, beginning from the consulship of Metellus.
Gravesque . . . amicicias : i. e. the coalition of the Trium-

served, without offending Au gustUS, or disobliging many families
that had been deeply engaged in the civil war, by opening
afresh wounds that were now nearly healed.

9. Musa tragaediae desit theatris .· i. e. you ought for a time
to relinquish your favourite pursuit‚ and abstain from writing
tragedies, till you have put the finishing hand to a work of so
much importance as that in which you are engaged.

10. Mox . . . cothurno .· ‘hereafter, when you shall have di-
gested and arranged the events in your history, you shall re-
sume the noble employment of writing tragedy with true Athe-
nian di nit .’

The {atligi-nus, or buskin, was frequently put for tragedy,
which had at that time reached a greater degree of excel—
lence at Athens than at any other place.

From the expression, publicas res ‹ar-tlindris, many have sup-
posed Pollio was consul at the time this ode was written, and
that this sentence had reference to the management of public
