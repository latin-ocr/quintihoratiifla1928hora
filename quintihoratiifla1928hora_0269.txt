12. Attalicis conditionibus : ‘by the wealth of Attalus3’ he
was king of Pergamus, and immensely rich. Having no chil-

dren, he made the commonwealth of Rome his heir.
13. Nunquam dimoveas .· ‘ you can never induce.‘—-Trabe

Cypria .· ‘in a vessel of Cyprus.’ This epithet is used because
Cyprus was at that time so distinguished for its commerce.
14. fiIqrtoilm .· The Myrtoan sea is a part of the AEgean‚ so

called from the island Myrtus.
20. Solido . . . die: i. e. to break in upon the hours of the day

usually devoted to labour, and indulge in drinking at his ease..

25. Sub Jove frigido : by remaining all night ‘in the cold air’
the huntsman shows the strength of his ruling passion.

29. Me: Wakefield and some others think that the whole
tenour of the ode requires Te in this place, as referring to the
poet’s patron Maecenas, and have substituted that word z but the
manuscripts do not authorize this change. The meaning pro-
bably is, the ivy crotous, bestowed as the reward of learned men
(or of successful poeta), delight me above all things.

34. Lesboz'im: Horace calls the lyre ‘Lesbiam' because Al-
caeus, the most eminent of the lyric poets‚ and some others, be-

longed to Lesbos.
For an explanation of the kind of verse used in this and the

subsequent odes, the student is referred to the metrical key.

ODE II.

The early Commentators were no doubt in an error in sup-
posing this ode to have been written in compliment to Octavius
upon the prodigies, which appeared soon after the assassination
of his uncle Julius Caesar. For at that time Horace was at
Athens, and he afterwards espoused thecause of Brutus3 and ·
it is hardly probable while enlisted under his banners that the
poet would have addressed a prayer for the preservation of Oc-
tavius, or invoked vengeance upon his own party.

The following historical facts, mentioned by Dion Cassiu8,.
explain several passages in the ode, and give a much more

natural occasion for writing it.
Octavius received the surname of Augustus on the 17‘th of

January in the year of Rome 727 3 and on the night following
there was a very uncommon inundation of the Tiber. A short
time before this, Octavius had addressed the Senate‚ and inti-
mated his intention of resigning the supreme power. He said
his object in assuming it was to avenge the death ofCaesar, and
to free Rome from the calamities under which it was suffering.
i The poet therefore avails himself of these incidents to ad-

dress Augustus, as the tutelary divinity of Rome 3 and after
complimenting him very delicately under the character of Mer-
cury, exhorts him to cherish the blessings of peace at home,

and to defend the Roman people from foreign foes.
