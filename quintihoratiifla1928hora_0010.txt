iv THE LIFE OF HORACE.

by saying, “that he sat between sighs and tears.'’ He had a

farm in the country of the Sabines, and a house at Tibur, now

Tivoli, the ruins of which are still shown to strangers. He

died in his fifty-ninth year3 so suddenly that he left no will,

and his property therefore reverted to the emperor. He was

ffliried in the cemetery on the Esquiline Hill, near the tomb of
aecenas.

The writings of Horace have an air of frankness and open-
ness about them3 a manly simplicity, and a contempt of af·
fectation, or the little pride of a vain and mean concealment,
which, at once, take hold on our confidence. We can believe
the account which he gives of his own character, without
scruple or suspicion. That he was fond of pleasure is con-
fessed3 but generally speaking he was moderate and tempe-
rate in his pleasures3 and his convivial hours seem to have been
far more intellectual, and more enlightened by social wit and
v wisdom, than are those of the common herd of Epicurean poets.

Horace, of all the writers of antiquity, most abounds with
that practical good sense, and familiar observation of life and
manners, which render an author, in a more emphatic sense,
the reader’s companion. Good sense, in fact, seems the most
distinguishing feature of his Satires3 for his wit seems rather
forced3 and it is their tone of sound understanding, added to
their easy, conversational air, and a certain turn sor fine raille-
ry, that forms the secret by which they please. In variety and
versatility his lyric genius is unrivalled by that of any poet with
whom we are acquainted3 and there are no marks of inequality
or of inferiority to himself. Whether his odes be of the moral
and philosophie kind3 or the heroic3 the descriptive3 or the
amatory, the light, and the joyous 3 each separate· species
would seem to be his peculiar province. His epistles evince
a knowledge of the weaknesses of the human heart, which
would do honour to a professed philosopher. What Quintilian,
and the moderns after him, call the “ Art of Poetry,” seems to
have been only the third epistle of the second book, addressed
to the Pisos. The style and manner differ in no respect from
the former epistles. The observations are equally desultory,
and we meet with the same strokes of satirical humour3 which
appear unsuitable to a didactic piece.÷÷
