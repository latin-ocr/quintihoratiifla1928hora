59. Qud . . . sulvus: sc. flente ; ‘ where he has a white
spot to be seen ; but tawny as to the rest of his body.’

ODE ΙΙ.

Horace addresses this ode to the Muse Melpomene, as the
patroness of lyric poetry. He thanks the Muses for their fa-
vours to him even from the hour of his birth3 and seems to im-
ply that he received in the first moments of life whatever dis-
tinguished him afterwards.. The ode is written with so much
beauty and feeling, that Scaliger says he would rather be the
author of it, than be the king of Arragon.

14. Soboles .· ‘ the youth of Rome, the queen of cities, see fit to
place me with the choirs of lyric poets.’

18. Ο Pieri: ‘ O Muse Melpomene.’ Pieri is the vocative
from Pieris, -tdis.

ODE III.

Augustus had desired Horace to write two odes3 one upon
'the Secular gemes, and the other upon the conquests of Dru-
sus and Tiberius in Pannonia. The poet commences this ode
with the praises of Drusus, as it was his first campaign, and as
he was more beloved by Augustus than Tiberius. In the XIIIth
ode of this book he continues the subJ'ect principally in praise
ο Tiberius.

1. Qualem . . . Vindelici: the order of construction is, Qua-
lem olim juventas et patrius vigor propulit nido, inscium laborum,
alitem ministrum fulminis, (cui Jupiter, rex deorum, permisit reg-

flavo,) vernique venti, nimbis jam remotis, docuere paventem inso-

18. Quibus (sc. Vindelicis). . . distuli .- it is matter of doubt
to commentators how these four verses came here. All admit
them to be unworthy of the poet, and brought in without ap-
parent reason. Some suppose it may have been a common
question, when talking of the conquests of Drusus, from whence
the Vindelici derived the the custom of arming themselves with
axes, like the Amazons. Others think they may have been
