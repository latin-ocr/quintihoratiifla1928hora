ODE XIX.

Horace, under pretence of being inspired by Bacchus, in-
dulges in the praises of Augustus more extravagantly than
might otherwise seem proper.

3. Mente ηουᾶ .· ‘ with new inspiration.’—Quibus . . . Jovis .·
the construction is, In quibus antris meditans <eternum cle-
eus egregii Caesaris audiar inserere illum stellis et consilio Jo-

14. 0 Naiadum . ,μ fraaeinos : ‘ Ο powerful king of the N aiads

tall ash-trees.’

ODE XX.

In this little ode Horace declares that he will not in future
hearken to the dictates of a hurtful passion, to which he had
been too long a slave. And it must be said, to his credit, that
he did actually give up, at the age of forty, when this ode was
written, his former habits of sensual indulgence. Though from
what he says, we have some reason to believe that resentment
had some share in forming the resolution to do so.

3. Nunc arma . . . custodit : it was usual to offer at the tem-
ple of some god the instruments of an art, which was discon-
tinued. In this case the temple of Venus was selected with
great propriety.

5. Laevum . . . latus .· he hangs up the arms of his midnight
revelry on the eastern wall os the temple, on the left side of
the goddess. For the statues of the gods were so placed as to
face the south3 consequently the east, which was esteemed the
happy quarter of the heavenS, was on their left hand.

6. Ponite .· the address is made to the attendants, who were
to deposit the arms as ordered.

8. Oppositis . . . minaces .· ‘ threating the doors closed against
us.’-Funalia et vectes et arcus .· ‘ torches‚ bars, and bows.’
These were to repulse the guards which the ladies might have
for their defence‚ and to force open the doors.
