ΤΟ THE METRES USED BY HORACE.

HORACE uses twenty different kinds of Measure, or varie-
ties of Metre. These are combined in sixteen different
ways, forming of course sixteen different StropheS‚ or
Stanzasf’g In order to know to which of these combine--
tions any ode belongs, we have only to find the first words
of that ode in the following Alphabetical Index3 and against
thern is placed the number of the combination to which
it belongs, and according to which it must be scanned.
For instance 3 suppose it were desired to know the kind of
verse contained in the first Ode of the first Book; look in
the Alphabetical Index on page 5254, and find in that the
first worda Moecenas atavis ; and against them stands VIl.
No. VII, then, of the Combinations on page 256, informs you
that the verse is Αεεῖερὶαῑῖὲαης and shows you how it may
be scanned. In the same way the method of scanning
every ode in Horace may be known, by finding the first
words of it in the Index, and referring to the number against
it, in the Combinations.

*A Strophe or Stanza includes as many lines as are necessary to
show all the different kinds of measure in an ode. It is called Strophe‚
which in Greek literally means a turning, because at the end of it, you
turn back to the same kind of verse with which you began.
