16. Ter pede terram .- a part of the festivities on this occasion
consisted in dancing.

ODE XIV.

It seems that Murena had been chosen augur, and that seve-
ral of his friends had met together in honour of the occasion3
and that among them were Horace, and another poet named
Telephus, who was a great scholar, and who undertook to enter*
tain the company with some grave discussion on ancient history.
Horace interrupts him by intimating that it were better to in-
quire where the best wine was to be had, with the requisites for
an entertainment, that they might drink their friend’s health in
honour of his new appointment. The hint succeeded, and we
are to imagine our poet in the midst of the entertainment,
giving orders for the manner of drinking, as though he were
king of the feast.

1. Quantum: i. e. O Telephus, you relate how many ages
passed between Inachus and Codrus, who devoted himself to
death for his country.

6. Quis . . . ignibus.- ‘ who will get the baths ready.’ The
Romans always bathed before they sat down to their entertain-

ωεὲἵῐῗῒεραο praebente . . . taces : ‘ who will furnish a house, and at

viipat 'ho'ur Ι shall find it well warmed, you say not a word about
a §hg-a Lunae : sc. poculum in honorem.

13. Qui Musas . . . vates .· the construction is, Vates, qui amat

24. Vicina .- i. e. 'our fair geighbour hdie, too young to be
the wife of envious old Lycus.

ODE XV.

M. Valerius Messala Corvinushaving engaged to sup with
Horace, the poet makes this address to a jar of choice old
wine, by which he intimates that he shall give his friend wine
as old as himself. He goes on in praise of wine, recount-
ing its wonderful powers.

1. Ο nata . . . pia testa -· i. e. 0 pia (sacra) testa, quoe contines
vinum natum (expressum) eodem anno quo natus sum. He calls
the jar pia, because it was made the same year in which he
was born himself.

5. Quocunque . . . die .· ‘you are worthy to be brought forth
on this happy day, who preserve the Massic wine, whatever be
the end for which it was chosen? Doer.

7. Descende .· wine was kept in the upper part of the house.

10. Sermonibus: ‘philosophy.’—Horridus.· ‘severe‚’ ‘stem’
