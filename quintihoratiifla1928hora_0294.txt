284 NOTES.

ODE IV.

This ode is an expression of friendship to Septimius, a Roman
knight of high standing. He was a poet and a soldier. He
had been a school-fellow, a long tried and intimate friend of
Horace, who here tells him, that, as they had passed the best
of their days together in toils and dangers, he now wishes to
retire with him, and to spend the evening of life in tranquillity,
either at his own seat at> Tibur, or with Septimius at Ta·
rentum.

1. aditure .· ‘ready to go with me ’ (if necessary) ‘to Cadiz,'
the farthest part of Spain, ‘ and against the Cantabrian, not yet
subdued,' &c Almost all commentators are agreed that this is
the sense3 as we say, I am ready to go with you any where :
and not that the poet actually anticipated any expedition of the
kind here mentioned.

5. Tibur . . . colono .· ‘ Tibur, founded by an Argive colonist.’
Tiburnus, Catillus, and Cora, three brothers from Argos, settled
a colony there.

7. Lasso .- sc. mihi.

10. Pellitis ovibus : the sheep of Tarentum, near which the
river Galaesus flowed, had wool of so fine a quality, that they
were covered with skins to preserve it from injury.

11. Laconi . . . Phalanto.- ‘by Lacedemonian Phalantus.’
Laco, or Lacon, gen. Laconis, adj.

14. Ubi ‘non . . . Venafro .- ‘where the honey does not yield
to that of Hymettus, and the olives vie with those of Venafrum.²
Hymettus is a mountain in Attica abounding in the finest Ἴ
honey. Venafrum is a city in Campania eminent for oil.

18. Aulon . . . uvis : the construction is, et aulon amicus ser-
tili Baccho minimam invidet Falernis uvis : Aulon is a hill near
Tarentum.

ODE V.

There has been some doubt who the Pompey· here addressed
was3 some have supposed it to be Pompeius Varus. But it is

“ pretty generally believed to have been Pompeius Grosphus.

He was an early friend and companion of our poet, and was
with him at the battle of Philippi. He also continued in opposi-
tion to Augustus afterwards. But when the peace was con-
cluded between Sextus Pompey and the Triumvirate‚ a general
amnesty was granted to all Pompey’s party. Grosphus, taking
advantage of this, returned to his friends3 on which occasion
Horace addressed *his ode to him, by way of congratulation,
which naturally turns on their common dangers and sufferings
in former days.
