sA'rIRE vm.

The poet introduces Priapus, overseer of the gmdens, com-
plaining against the sorceresses Canidia and Sagana 3 and
describing their secret enchantments and their diabolical prac-
tices.

3. AEIaluit esse deum.- ⁴ concluded to make a god of me.’
When the artifieer found the inutile lignum unfit even for a
stool to sit upon, he made a god of it. This is satire indeed
upon the mythology of his country.

4. Dextra: the image held a cane or club in its right hand,
and a reed fastened to his head.

6. Novis.- Maecenas had lately built a palace‚ and laid out
extensive gardens in the neighbourhood ot the Esquiline Hill.

7. Angustia . . . cellis : the bodies of the poor were in times
palat brought here from their narrow cells, or hutS‚ by their
fe ow slaves.

10. Pantolabo: both these persons were still living, but as
they had squandered away their estates in dissipation, Horace
appoints a burial-place for them with the lowest of the rabble.

11. Cippus .· when ground was set aside for any use, it was
customary sor the dimensions to be marked on a pillar set up
for the purpose on the margin of it.

12. Hoeredes . . . sequeretur .· ‘ that this burying ground might
never revert to the heirs of the estate.’

14. Quo . . . agrum: ‘ from which but lately men had be-
held the field deformed and white with human bones.'

16. Quum . . . animos : ‘ although thieves and beasts of prey,
accustomed to-infest this region, were not so vexatious to me as
those hags, who by their enchantments and poisons disturb the
shades of men.’ After quantam, understand veneficoe sunt. Pri-
apus uses the present tense, although speaking of the state of
things on Esquiliae prior to the improvements recently made
b Maecenas. ·

y24. Cum Sagana majore: ‘with Sagana the elder! There
were two sisters of this name.

30. Lanea .- the image of wool represented the person whom
the sorceresses favoured 3 that of wax, the intended victim of
the charm. The waxen image melted, as indicative of their
conquest over the person it represented.

38. Pediatia : to express his contempt for the effeminacy of
Pediatius‚ Horace gives him the feminine gender.

41. Lupi . . . colubrae: ‘ the hair of a wolf and the tooth of a
spotted snake.’

44.F Voces . . . duarum : ‘ at the words and actions of these
two uries?

46. Dffssa .- the wood, not being perfectly dry, was split by
the heat with a loud crack, which frightened the wstches, and
they ran off in great terror.
