ODE XIV.

Palinodia signifies a ‘ recantation,’ or the retracting of what
has been said. It seems, our poet, having been supplanted by
a more successful competitor for the favour os Tyndaris, the
daughter of Gratidia, wrote an abusive and scurrilous ode to her.
He now wishes to retract what he had done, and to reinstate
himself in the favour of Tyndaris, to whom he was much at-
tached. He pleads, as his excuse, the influence of irresistible
passion, and denies ever having indulged the feelings expressed
in his former ode.

1. Matre pulchroi: The former ode is said to have begun
thus ε >
Ο matre turpi filia turpior!

2. Quem . . . Hadriano : Quem cunque is divided by Tmesis.
⁶ You will destroy, in any'way you please, my slanderous Iam-
3163, whether you see fit to throw them into the fire, or the Ha-

riatic sea.’

5. Dindymene.- i. e. Cybele, so called from Dindymus, or
DindymiS, a mountain in Phrygia consecrated to her service
and worship.

11. Tremendo . . . tumultu: ‘with his dread thunderbolts!

13. Fertur Prometheus . . . desectam : i. e. Prometheus, when,
on account of the sailure of his materials, which were exhausted
in making other animals„ he was compelled to blend in the first
formed man a particle (undique desectam) taken from every other ·
animal, is said also to have placed in our breast something of
the fury of the raging lion.

Therefore, the poet would argue, he may justly hope for par-
don for an act proceeding from an infirmity of human nature.

17. Thyesten .· the dreadful effects of passion, may be learned
from the story of Thyestes. See Class. Dict.

22. Pectoris . . ‚sei-vor: ‘ furious anger.’

25. Nunc ego . . . tristia: how far Horace succeeded in re-
ggining the favour of Tyndaris, we learn from the following
o e to her.
