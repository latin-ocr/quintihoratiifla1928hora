THE SECULAR POEM.

THIS poem, designes] to be sung at the celebration of the
Secular Games, by a choir of fifty-four boys and girls, an equal
number of each, is considered one of the most finished per-
formances of antiquity. These games were celebrated once in
an age, or about a hundred years, They were instituted in con-
sequence of certain ⁴prophecies contained in the Sibylline Books.
This celebration was originally distinguished by three solemn
festivals, which were afterwards united in one festival, which
continued three days and three nights successively. The first
celebration of the Secular Games was in the year of Rome 2453
the second was in 305 3 the third was in 5053 the fourth was in
605; and the fifth, for which Horace wrote this poem, was in
737. It was therefore a hundred and thirty-two years since the
last celebration. The present solemnities were announced with
great pomp and preparation. The heralds were sent out into
the provinces to invite all the world to a festival, such as they
never had seen, and never again would see. The Quinde-
cemviri, some days before, distributed among the people certain
lustral, or purifying substances, such as bitumen, sulphur, and
certain kinds of grain. Sacrifices were made to the gods 3 and
their benedictions were implored upon the interests of Rome,
which was the great object of this festival. y
