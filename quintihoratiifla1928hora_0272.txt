11. Immolare .· So deeply were the ancient heathens im-
pressed with the idea of the goodness of some overruling power,

manifested in the return of the seasons, that they offered stated '

sacrifices in gratitude for this proof of continued care.

18. Non regna . . . talis.- ‘you will not choose a king of
the feast by a cast of the dice.’ This refers to the practice of

ODE V.

Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa was a distinguished general,
and so much esteemed by Augustus, that he gave him his
daughter Julia in marriage. Agrippa wished his achievements
to be celebrated by Horace, who, while he excuses himself
from the more laborious and responsible task of writing a for-

many, of his artfully performing what he pretends to decline
doin .

8. Nec . . . domum .· i. e. nor the cruel murders committed by

the family of Pelops, which have furnished so fruitful a subject Α

for the tragic muse of Sophocles.
