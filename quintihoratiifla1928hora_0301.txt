17. Seu Libra . . . undae : the construction is, Seu Libra, seu
formidolosus ScorpiuS, pars violentior natalis horse, aspicit me,
seu Capricornus tyrannus Hesperiae undae. Libra was consider-
ed a fortunate sign, or constellation, to be born under 3 but the

talis horoe .· ‘ the most dangerous sign of our nativity.’—Aspicit

the horoscope, where reference is had to the sign, or the part
of the sign, which appears above the horizon at the moment of
birth.

sacrifices of the patron and the poet may, therefore, have refer-
ence to their different rank and means.

tivated mind, content with a competency and the affection of
his friends, is the truly happy man.

3. Trabes Hymettiae.- from mount Hymettus3 the marble

be employed where wood had always been deemed sufficient,
constituted a part of the extravagance which the poet censure-s.

costly and exquisite kind: “factus e marmore in remotiore Africae
