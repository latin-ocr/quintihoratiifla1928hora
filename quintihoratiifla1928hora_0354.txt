SATIRE VI.

In this satire Horace attempts to show that real greatness is
quite independent of external circumstances3 and that true no-
bility consists in personal worth, and not in the distinctions of
birth and family. He mentions his own case as a proof thar
Maecenas selected his friends for their personal qualities ; since
he had no advantages of family to recommend him, And he pays
a grateful tribute to the memory of his father for having trained
him in the path of virtue, and instilled those principles into his
mind which· seem to have laid the foundation of his happiness.

1. Non quia . . . natum .· the construction is, O Maecenas,
non suspendis adunco naso, ut plerique solent, ignotos, ut me ηα-
tum libertino patre, quia nemo est generosior te quidquid Lydo-
rum incoluit Etruscos fineS, nec quod suit tibi maternus atque
paternus avus qui olim imperitarent magnis legionibuS.—Lydo-
rum quidquid .- ‘ of all the Lydians.'

5. Naso suspendis adunco : ‘ you sneer at.'

6. Libertino .· libertinus originally meant the son of a freed-
man3 but afterwards both libertus and libertinus were used to
signify a freedman. ⁴

9. Ignobile .· because Servius Tullius was born of a female
slave. And yet by his own merits he rose to sovereignty.

12. Contra, Loevinum . . . populo : ‘whereas, on the contrary,
Laevinus, though belonging to the family of Valerius Poplicola,
who‘ helped to banish Tarquin the Proud from his kingdom,
was never valued one penny, even by the Roman people, whose

humour you know.’

14. Licuisse: i. e. aestimatum esse. Licere was a word used
at auctions 3 as, parvo pretio licet (sc. habere rem), ‘ the thing is
chea 3

20.p Moveret .· ⁴ would exclude me,’ from the senate.

22. Pelle: i. e. sorte, or conditione.

24. N⁸on minias . . . generosis .· ‘ no less the ignoble than the
hi h-born.'

ΞΕ. Quo tibi . . . tribuno : sc. profuit ; ‘ what did it profit you,
Tullius, to resume the laticlavejz you had ¹put off, and become
tribune P—Tribuno, for tribunum, by attraction agreeing with
tibi, after the manner of the Greeks. This Tullius was of low
birth, and had been compelled to relinquish the laticlave by
Caesar, because he espoused the cause of Pompey3 but aster
the death of Caesar he resumed it.

27. - Ut quisque . . . pellibus : ‘ when any one is so crazy as to
cover halfhis leg with black leather.' The buskins worn by
senators were originally black-

30. Barrus: a vain, conceited spendthrist, who wished to
be thought handsome.

38. Tune . . . audes .- ‘ dare you, the son of a Syrus, a Da-
mas, or a Dionysius Ρ ’ These are the names of slaves.
