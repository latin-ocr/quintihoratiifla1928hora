omas, BOOK 1. 271

9. Sithoniis.- the Sithonians were a people of Thrace, put
here for the Thracians generally.-Non levis .· ‘hostile.’ The
Thracians being very intemperate, and committing all man-
ner of crimes in their seasons of excess, Bacchus is said to
have been hostile to them for abusing his gifts.

10. Quum sas . . . avidi: the construction is, Quum illi avidi
libidinum discernunt saa atque nefas exiguo fine.

12. Nec variis . . . rapiam: ‘nor will I expose to view thy
secrets covered with various leaves.’

There were certain articles sacred to Bacchus kept secret in
a ehest or basket, which was covered with vine-leaves. This
was brought out of the temple, and carried about during the
celebration of his orgies. ·

13. Tene: ‘restrain.'

ODE XVII.

It seems that Maecenas had intimated to Horace his intention
‘of making him a visit at his country-seat at Tibur, in the Sa·
bine territory, about twenty οι· twenty-five miles from Rome.

The poet intends to give his illustrious friend a welcome to
his house, but to prevent any disappointment in one accustomed
-to the choice wines and other luxuries of the court at Rome, he
tells him he will find but plain fare.

1. Vile . . . Sabinum : ‘ cheap Sabine wine?

2. Graecd . . . plausus .- ‘which I sealed in a Grecian jar the
very day on which you received such applause in the theatre.’
—Testd .- the Romans, when most careful to preserve their wine,
and to correct its crudity, put it into earthen jars, which
were at first imported from Greece.—Levi.· from lino ‚· when
the casks were filled, they were sealed or closed up with pitch
or wax. Although the Sabine wine was by no means worthy of
so much care and expense, yet, as on the occasion referred to,
Maecenas, on making his appearance at the theatre for the
first time after a severe illness, had been received with accla-
mations and shouts of joy, Horace had preserved the date in
this way3 and now pays a very delicate compliment to his pa-
tron by alluding to that circumstance.

5. Paterni fluminis.- the Tiber flows from Etruria, where
the ancestors of Maecenas dwelt.

8. Imago .· ‘ the echo!

9. Praelo . . . Caleno: ‘ by a Calenian wine-press.' The best
presses were made at Cales. The sense seems to be this3 ‘ You
will drink the choice Caecubian wine, at home if you please, or
where it is to be had3 but I have, neither Falernian nor For-
mian wine.’ Some suppose this to be a hint for Maecenas to
bring some wine with hun, better than was to be found at Tibur.
