ODE XIII.

The Romans believed that many of their gods passed their
summers in one country, and their winters in another. Faunus
was of this number. He was supposed to come into Italy onthe
lath of February, and to return to Arcadia on the 5th of De-
cember. Both these days were observed by sacrifices and fes-
tivity in honour of Faunus, who was supposed to preside over
their flocks and fields. This ode was probably written for one
of his festivals. In the first part, the poet intreats Faunus, if
he pays him due honours, to smile upon his fields and preserve
the tender offspring of his fiocks3 and in the second, he sets
forth the joy of the village on the return of his autumna] feast,
when man and beast will relax from their teil, and rejoice in
the bounty of their benefactor.
