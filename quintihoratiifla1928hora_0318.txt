ODE XVII.

Phidyle was a rustic woman, and, as most commentators sup-
pose, the poet’s house-keeper in the country. She seems to
have imbibed the opinion that sacrifices to the gods were more
or less acceptable in proportion to their intrinsic value. Horace
in this ode attempts to convince her, that the gods regarded the
disposition of mind with which sacrifices were offered, rather
than the costliness of the gifts3 that purity of life and good
intentioris were of most importance3 and that with these any
offerings, however small, were acceptable.

1. Supinas : when the ancients prayed to the celestial gods
they raised their hands ‘ with the palms upwards '3 but turned
them downwards when they addressed the infernal gods.

2. Nascente Lami .· the occasions were very numerous on
which it was supposed proper to make sacrifices to the gods;
Horace would imply that once a month, ‘at the new moon‚’
was sufficient, and then it was not necessary to be extravagant.

3. Hormi .· i. e. praesentis anni. Adj. hornus, -a, -um.

7. Dulces alumni.- i. e. agni, haedi; sc. sentient,

9. Nam, quae . . . tinget: the construction is, Nam victima
diis devota, quae pascitur nivali Algido inter quereus et ilices, aut
crescit in Albanas· herbis, tinget cervice secures pontificum. The
meaning is, that these victims are designed for public sacrifices,
which may with propriety be more magnificent than those of
private individuals, who ought to make their offerings propor-
tionate to their station and abilities.
