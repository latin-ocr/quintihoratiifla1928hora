could not pass the Styx under a hundred yeam, if the body
were not buried. To this, reference is made at the conclusion
of the ode, where the mariner is entreated to render this little
service, of throwing earth upon the body, which was of so much
consequence to the soul.

7. Occidit: The shade of Archytas here replies to this effect:
‘ Do not be surprised‚ mariner, that I have shared the common
lot of humanity3 for Tantalus died, though he was admitted to
the society of the gods3 and Tithonus, PythagoraS‚’ δια. Ar-
chytas seems to console himself hy the reflection, that others so
much greater that himself had submitted to the same necessity.

10. Panthoiden.- the son of Panthous was Euphorbus, who
was slain at the Trojan war by Menelaus. Pythagoras, to estab-
lish his doctrine of the transmigration of souls, declared, among
other proofs, that he was himself at the Trojan war, centuries
before, in the person of this Euphorbus ; and says he recognised,
in the Temple of Juno, the shield which he wore when he was
Euphorbus 3 which being taken down, refixo, was found to have
the marks which he had described, as on his shield.

14. Jadice . . . verique .· ‘And in my opinion he was no ordi-
nary observor of nature and of'truth.’

20. Proserpina: this refers to a belief among the ancients,
that Proserpine attended on persons about to die, and cut from
their heads a lock of hair, as an offering to the infernal deities ;
and that they could not die till this service was performed.

25. Sic, quodcunque : the meaning is, If you do this, Ι hope that,
whatever daug-ers the tempest may threaten you with, when
navigating the Italian sea, may fall upon the Venusian woods.

30. Negligis . . . committere.- ‘are you indifferent about corn-
mitting a crime to be atoned for by your innocent descendants?
The ancients believed that the gods were enraged against
any one who, having found a dead body, should leave it un-
buried3 and that they punished both him and his posterity.

34. Teque piacula nulla resolvent .- ‘ and no atoning sacrifices
shall free you from punishment)

36. Curras : sc. ut; ‘ sor you to hasten on.' .

ODE XXIV.

Augustus sent an army against the Arabians in the year of
Rome 7⁶29, under AElius Gallus. The expedition was unsuc-
cessful, on account of a sickness which prevailed in the army.

Iccius, a man of retired and literary habits, voluntarily joined
the expedition. Horace, with a good deal of pleasantry, ridi-
cules Iccius for leaving the ease and quiet of philosophical pur-
suits to encounter the dangers and fatigues of war, while he
supposes him to meditate some mighty proofs of his valour.

1. Beatis . . . gazis: Strabo says, that Augustus made war
upon the Sabaeans, a people of Arabia Felix, on account of their
