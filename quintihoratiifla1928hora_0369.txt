SATIRES. BOOK 11. 359

SATIRE IV.

This satire consists of an amusing dialogue between the po-
et and one Catius5 who pretends to be a great philosopher, and
also to be profoundly vei-sed in the science of oookery. But he
becomes ridiculous by attaching so much importance to what is
of little consequence3 and more particularly by exposing his.
utter ignorance of the subJ'ect on which he discourseS. The·
whole is a. keen satire upon that class of men who place their
supreme happiness in the pleasures of the table. This he con-
siders an abuse of Epicureanism, in the refined forms of which
he was himself a believer.

12. Longa . . . erit .· 4 to such eggs as shall have along ap-
pearance.' Catius very properly begins with the eggs, which

Catius, are in general false and absurd.

stall ’3 i. e. to buy them all at a great price.

ed up with sauce-'

47. Νουα . . . promit: ‘ only produces new kinds of pastry.’

54. Lino : ‘ by being strained through linen.’

57. Ima . . . aliena: ‘attracting foreign substances sinks to
