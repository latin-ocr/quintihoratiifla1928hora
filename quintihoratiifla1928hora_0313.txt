25. Negligem . . . cavere .· ‘ relaxing your anxie ¹ ‚ since you
are a private man, do not be too solicitous about public con-
cerus.’-Privatus.· although Maecenas was praesect of Rome,
yet, as compared with the emperour, he is properly called a pri-
vate man. Others understand it thus z ‘ Divest yourself of your
public character and assume that of aprivate citizen for the
present occasion.’

Horace had formed an attachment to Lyde, who, being
young and a stranger to love, paid little regard to his profes-
sions. The poet therefore addresses this ode to Mercury, in-
treating him to inspire a song, the strains of which may make
an impression on the obdurate fair one. And we gather from
the XXII. Ode of this Book that he did not write in vain.

1. Te . . . magistro .· ‘ under your instruction.’

5. Nec loquax olim: before Mercury conceived the plan of
forming the lyre, no music was made upon the testudo or tor-
toise shell.

9. Ta potes . . . silvas .- this alludes to the fable of Orpheus.

17. Tityos .· or Tityus ; the Greek termination is in os.

18. Urna .· this was the pitcher or vessel with which the
water was taken up and poured into the tub or cask (dolium),
having holes in its bottom.

19. Danai: For the story of the Danaides, see Class. Dict.

21. Audiat Lyde .- i. e. let Lyde hear what punishments
await hard-hearted maidens.

29. Una .· Hypermnestra was the only one of all the fisty
daughters of Danaus, who did not kil] her husband on their mar-
riage night, according to the command of their father.

30. Perjurum .· he is called perjured, because he had violated
the faith and sanctity of a father—in-law, which he had pledged
to his son-in-law.

47. Et nostri . . . querelam .· i. e. and engrave upon my tomb-
stone an epitaph that shall perpetuate the sad remembrance of
my love.

ODE IX.

N ear to Horaoe’s villa, in the Sabine territory, there was a
beautiful fountain‚ called the fountain of Bandusia, from the
name of the place in which it was situated. In accordance
with the popular belief that some spirit or Genius presided over
each fountain‚ our poet proposes to offer a sacrifice to this, and
to consecrate it to immortality.

2. Dulci digne mero .- i. e. worthy of the wine he intends to
pour out in libation.

6. Frustra .- he was in vain destined to be the leader of the
flock, since he will be sacrificed.
