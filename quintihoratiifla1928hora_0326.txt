ODE IV.

The first ode in this book was composed in honour of Augus-
tus, and in the hope that hc would return immediately. This
was written in consequence of his delay 3 and is an expressmn
of the affection of the Romans for Augustus, and of their impa-
tience for his return. The other was animated with Pin-darie
fire, and seemed to be an earnest of the triumph that awaited
Augustus3 while this is full of tenderness and desire sor his

return.
