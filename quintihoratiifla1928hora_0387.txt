⁸EPISTLES. BOOK ΙΙ. 377

'EPIsTLE II.

Julius Florus, to whom this epistle is addressed, was, at the
time it was written, abs sent with Tiberius Ν610. Horace gives
his reasons for not 'having complied with the 1· quest of Florus
that he would send him some lyric poems. He tells him that
116 wished to devote himself to the study of philosophy. And
throughout the epistle he intersperses many excellent precepts
for the regulation of the conduct, and for securing a good
and happyo life. He commences with a lively and amusing
account of a slave· dealer‚ as an example of the verbosity and

knavery of that class of men.
14. Semel hic ceseavit: ‘he was once in fault3 and hid him-

self behind the stairs for fear of the whip‚ as was natural
enough.’ Doering prefers this construction to pendentis in
scalis, the usual one. The seller uses 1116 word cessavit for
ausugim to soften the crime of running away, which was con·
sidered so important a defect 1n the character of a slave, that
the sale was made void by law, if this was not ment10ned to 1116

pulgilssffnae securus.- ‘ fearless of any punishment,’ for the

fraud he committed; as the law could not reach him, aster he
had mentioned the fact that the slave had run away.

cession‚ if nevertheless, you impeach the laws protecting me '—
Mamm facientia.- i. e. me adjuvantia. Jaeck.

28. Vehemens lupus: sc. ut; ‘like a raging wolf.’

48. Νοη responsura lacertis.- ‘unable to cope with the arms‚’
or forces, of Augustus Caesar.

52. Sed q.2wd ‚vers-us.- i. 6. but now possessing every thing
thatI wishg} what doses of hellebore could cure my madness,
if Ι did not think it better to sleep quietly than to attempt
writing poetry again. 9

60. Bioneis sermonibus. i. 6. with such keen satire as Bion of
Borysthenes 1s said to have written.

81. Ingenium: ‘a man of genius'

87. Frater. ,illm the poet pass es suddenly to another top-
ic; that of 1116 mutual commendation and prais e of certain
poets. He says there were at Rome two friends, the one a
rhetorician‚ and the other a lawyer, who agreed to extol each
other. The lawyer made the rhetorician a second Gracchus· ‚
and he 16 turn called him another Mucius, Mucius was a cele-
Jrateod writer upon the civil law. Frater seems to be used for

rien
