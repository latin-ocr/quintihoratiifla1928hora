Tms ode was written by Horace, aster the completion of his
works, as a dedication of them to Maecenas, his patron and
friend. The poet describes with much felicity the different
views of men with respect to happiness 3 and pourtrays some of ’
their ruling passions. In conclusion he compliments Maece-
nas on his taste for the fine artS, and his love of learning,
by intimating that he shall not consider his own claims to rank
width the Lyric poets established, without the sanction of his
Ju gment.

1. mavis edite regibus .- ‘ descended of royal ancestors.'
Maecenas, so long distinguished as the favourite of Augustus,
and still more so for the protection and encouragement which
he afforded to men of learning and of genius, was descended
from the ancient kings of Etruria or Tuscany. To him, says
Mr. Sanadon, the present world is in a great measure indebted
for all the wit and learning of the Augustan age 3 and even at
this day the name of Maecenas is a title not unworthy of persons
of the noblest character, who know, like him, how to animate
the spirit of emulation among writers by their favour and gene-
rosit .

ZYO et prees-{dium .· With much propriety Horace addresses
him as his guardian and delightful honour 3 since Maeeenas not
only procured his pardon from Augustus, for fighting against
him with Brutus and the republicans at Philippi, but even
brought him into peculiar favour with that illustrious personage.

6. Dominos .· this word must be referred to deos ,· and is not
the object of evehit, as some have supposed, applying it to the

ΒζῐῗᾲῙῙ-ῗιῗηοε sc. juvat ; i. e. one ambitious of political distinction.

8. Tergeminis tollere honoribus-.- ‘ to raise him to the highest
honours.’ The word tergeminis is probably used in reference
to the highest grades of office among the Romans, viz. the
AEdileship, the Praetorship, and the Consulship.

9. Illum: sc. juvat ; i. e. another, whose ruling passion is

welzlllthuidquid . . . areis .· ‘all the grain that is collected from

Lybian threshing-floors.’ Lybia was a part of Africa particu-
larly fertile in grain.
