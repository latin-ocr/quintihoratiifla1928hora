264 NOTE S.

ODE VII.

In this ode, addressed to Lydia, a female of great beauty, but
of worthless character, Horace draws the picture of a youth
who has become the victim of a deep and destructive passion.

2. Sybarin . . . perdere .- ‘ why are you hastening to destroy
Sybaris by cherishing his guilty passion Ρ ’

SybariS‚ a youth of fortune and of ingenuous character, hav-
ing yielded to the allurements of sensuality, had abandoned his
manly exercises and his former companions, and was hastening
¹ - to destruction by that fatal infatuation which has led more

youths to perdition than the whole catalogue of other vices.

6. Lupcztis : the Romans had a kind of curb bits called sraeni
lupati, from their resemblance to the uneven teeth of a wolf,

luzgasblivum .· the ancients anointed their bodies with oil before

commencing their gymnastic exercises.

10. Livida .- i. e. bruised by wearing heavy armour.

14. Filium . . . Thetidis.- Achilles. Thetis, the mother of
Achilles, was warned by an oracle, that, if he went to the siege
of Troy with the other Grecian princes, he would be slain there.
To prevent him from going, she caused him to be clad in female
attire, and sent to the court of Lycomedes, that he might pass
for one of his daughters and escape discovery. But as another
oracle had declared that Troy could never be taken without
Achilles, Ulysses was sent in quest of him, and had the art to
discover him by placing a splendid sword among some female
ornaments exhibited before the daughters of LycomedeS‚ which
was instantly seized by Achilles. . ι

16. Cultus : his dress: i. e. a boy’s dress.

ODE VIII.

It would seem, from the tenour of this ode, that something had
happened to disturb and depress the mind of Thaliarchus3 and
that Horace, probably at this time on a visit to him at his coun-
try seat, near mount Soracte in Tuscany, about twenty-six
miles from Rome, wrote it to enliven his friend.

It is highly coloured with our poet’s Epicurean principleS‚ and
especially‘enforces his favourite doctrine, that man should not
trouble himself about futurity, and that all he has to do is to
make the most of present enjoymentS, and to leave the rest to
the (rods.

Sd³me have supposed Thaliarchus to be a fictitious name 3 and
that the whole is an imitation of an ode of Alcaeus.

8. Diotci .· this was an earthen vessel, containing about nine .
gallons, with two ears, or handles, by which it was carried.—
Sabind .· i. 'erin *which Sabine wine hasbeen put.
