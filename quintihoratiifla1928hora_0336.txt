EPODE IV.

In this epode the poet inveighs vehemently against some per-
son who, from the condition of a slave, had become a military
tribune, and was making an offensive display of his wealth and
dignity, to the annoyance of the more reputable part of the
community. It is commonly supposed to be addressed to Me-
nas, a freedman of Gneus Pompey, and in most manuscripts it is
inscribed to him.

1. Lupis . . . compede .- the construction is, Quanta discordia
sortito obtigit lupis et agnis, tanta est mihi tecum, Ο Mena, pe-
ruste quod ad latus funibus Ibericis et quod ad crura ἅτινά com-
pede—Sortito .- ‘ naturally.’

3. Peruste .· ‘ marred or hardened.’ Menas had been a pirate
before he served Pompey‚ and had been scourged, and in

, chains.

7. metiente te .- ‘ as you proudly strut along?

9. Vertat huc et huc : ⁶ turns away in disgust.’

12. Proeconis ad fastigium : ⁴ till the beadle was weary.'

16. Othone contempto: in spite of Otho's law, which assigned
seats in the theatrejo the equestrian order separate from the
people3 and also made a distinction between those who were
knights by birth, and those who were promoted to that rank.
This feHOW, who had been a slave, takes his place in the first
seatS, which were appropriated exclusively to those born
kniohts.

1⁸7. Quid attinet . . . pondere .· i. e. to what purpose is it that
so many brazen-beaked ships were sent Ρ

20. Hoc . . . militum.- ‘if such a wretch be made military

tribune?

EPODE V.

Horace here describes the diabolica] rites and ceremonies of

an assemblage of sorceresseS, of which Canidia is the principal
character. They have taken a boy of noble birth, whom they
are about to put to death by torture, in order to prepare from
his marrow and dried liver a philtre, or love potion, capable of
recalling an inconstant lover to her arms.
· 1. At.- the scene opens in a pathetic manner by the exclama-
tion of the terrified boy, who perceives with horror the glaring
eyes of the hags all turned upon him, with a flend-like expres-
sion, which cannot be misunderstood.

5. Te .· i. e. Canidia.—Si vocata . . . adfuit .- i. e. if you were
ever a mother.

7. Purpurea .· youth of family wore the toga proeteoeta, a gown
bordered with purple, till they were seventeen years old. The
boy con{ures Canidia by this token of his rank, which ought to
protect um.
