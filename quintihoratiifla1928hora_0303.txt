6. Turbida-m loetatur: ‘exults tumultuously.’

7. Parce: ‘spare me.’ Feeling unable to bear the full in-
spiration of the god, he intreats him to sorbeam, and not to
strike him with his thyrsus ,· for in this way Bacchus was sup-
posed to excite the phrenzy of his followers.

9. Thyiadas.- the Thyiades were the infuriated Bacchanals‚
or priestesses of Bacchus.

12. Iterare: i. e. iterum iterumque laudare. Doer. Bacchus
was supposed to produce, and cause an abundance of wine,
milk, and honey.

13. Fas ct.- and it it lawful for me to sing—Conjugis .· i. e.
Ariadne. She was said to be translated by Bacchus to the
heavens‚ and presented with a starry crown, called Gnossia
corona, or Seven Stars.

14. Penthei : Pentheus was a king of Thebes, who, for slight-
ing the rites of Bacchus, was torn to pieces by his own mother,
sisters, and aunt.

16. Lycurgi .- Lycurgus king of Thrace, finding his sub-
jects too much addicted to wine, ordered all the vines in
his kingdom to be rooted up. For this offence Bacchus caused
him to go mad and to cut off his own feet.

17. Mare. barbarum: i. e. Indicum. Bacchus was said to
have extended his conquests to the Indus and the Ganges,

20. Bistonidum : the Bistonides were the Thracian women,
Bacchanals.

23. Leonis: Bacchus is said to have tranformed himself into
a lion, and under this form to have fought the giantS‚ and killed
Rhoetus.

25. Quanquam . . . dictus.- ‘although you were said to be
better suited to dances and soenes of mirth.’

29. Insons : without offering to hurt you—Aureo cornu deco-
rum: ‘graceful with your golden horns.’ There are various
reasons, but none very satisfactory, why Bacchus is repre-
sented with horns.

ODE XVII.

Horace here predicts the glory and immortality of his name.
And with the true spirit of a poet he imagines himself al-
ready assuming the form and facultIes of a swan, and soar-
rng above the earth, over which he is about to take his aeria]
flight. As he will leave the humble abodes of men, so he
will shake off “this mortal coil,” and cease to be an obJect of
human sympathy or sorrow. He wishes not for the empty hon-
ours of a burial, nor the waste of useless tears on his account,
Since he shall not die.

1. Non usitata . . . vates.- ‘ Ι as a poet, in my two-sold charac-
