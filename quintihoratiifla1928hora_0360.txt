Augustus appointed five judges, of whom Metius Tarpa was

the stage. The recital was commonly in the temple of Apollo,

tor cannot refer to the inventor of satire, Lucilius, as Heindorf

ille does not agree with his character. Auctor means scriptor ;

and the passage refers to Ennius,

the fiat end, so formed for the purpose of erasing, and smooth-
ing the wax on which they wrote.
