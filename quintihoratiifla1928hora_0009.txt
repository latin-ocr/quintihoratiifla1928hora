THE LIFE OF HORACE.

QmNTus HORA'rms chcus was born at venusium in
Apulia,···sixty-four years before Christ. His father was a freed-
man, and collector of the revenue3 and gave his son a liberal
education at Rome and Athens. Horace, when a young man,
attached himself to BrutuS‚ and was in the battle of Philippi,
with the rank of military tribune. He fied in the rout of that
day, and was taken prisoner 3 but obtained a pardon‚ and after-
wards was distinguished by the favour and friendship of Maece-
nas. He filled the office of a clerk to the treasury3 and assisted
the emperor as his private amanuensis. This appears from the
fragment of a letter from Augustus to his minister. “I used to
be equal to the writing of my own letters3 but I am now so
pressed with a multiplicity of business, and so infirm, that I
wish you to bring me our friend Horace. Let him come, then,
and leave that parasitical table for my palace, and assist me in
writing my letters.’' Another fragment of a letter from Au-
gustus to Horace, is expressed in terms of the most easy and
playful familiarity. ‘⁶ Dionysius has conveyed your little volume
to me3 which, not to quarrel with its brevity‚ I take in good
part. But you ⁵seem to me fearful, lest your works should be
bigger than yourself. However, what you want in height, is
made up to you by that little round body of yours. You should,
therefore, write such a roll, as may go, not round a stick, but a
quart measure3 and then the circumference of your volume
may be squab and swollen, like the rotundity of your little bel·
ly.’' This is a pleasing personal trait. Horace has, himself,
given us some interesting hints of his person and manners.
He was gray before his time3 fond of basking in the sun3 and
of taking a siesta on the bank of a river. He speaks of break-
ing stones and turning up the ground, when in the country3

and when in town, of sauntering in the market, or riding out on Δ

a dock-tailed mule, which he sat awkwardly. He dined on
a pancake and vegetables 3 and divided the rest of the day be·
tween reading and writing, the bath and the tennis-court.
He was subject to a defluction in the eyes3 as was Virgil to a
complaint of asthma3 and Augustus used to rally the two poets,
