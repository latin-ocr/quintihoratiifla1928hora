ODE XXIX.

In the year of Rome 726, Augustus enrolled two armies, in-
tending to lead one of them in person against the Brstons, and
to send the other under AElius Gallus into Arabia. Horace,
ever ready to express his gratitude and good will towards his
friend and patron, wrote this address to Fortuna 3 invoking her
aid towards a favourable result of these expedition&

When Augustus was actually on his march, intending to pass
through France, and transport his army over to Britain, he was
met by an embassy from Britain, which accepted the terms he
proposed. He therefore gave up the expedition. ’

1. Antium .· this was a city of Italy, the capital of the Vol-
scians. It had a commodioris hal-bour, and was a place of con-
siderable importance. There was, in this city, a temple to For-
tune, famous for the, splendid gifts with which it was enriched,
as well as for the lots cast there, and the responses of its
oracle. Fortune is therefore said to govern it.

2. Praesens .· i. e. ready and able. ’

12. Metuant.- ‘reverence3 do homage to.'

13. Injurioso . . . fra-ngat .· ‘that thou mayest not with violent
foot cast down the yet standing pillar of state 3 and that a
thronging multitude may not excite the quiet citizens by crying‚
“To armS, To arms‚'’ and thus overthrow the government.’

17. Saeva Necessitas: This description is highly coloured:
‘Stern Necessity always precedes thee, bearing in her brazen
hand spikes and wedges.’ The wedges were not to be used in
splitting, but in making more compact3 and the partsi so
compressed, when of wood‚ were to be secured by the long
nails3 when of stone, by iron hooks, let in and fastened with
melted lead, liquidum plumbum. The uncus is not intended,
as supposed by some, for an instrument of punishment.

22. Nec comitem abnegat: sc. se.

23. Utcunque mutata . . . veste .- ‘however much you change
your dress-³ We may suppose prosperous fortune to be clad
splendidly, and adverse fortune meanly. ⁷ .

29. Sernes .· i. e. may you attend Caesar on his march against
ι {le Britons, and also the expedition about to be sent into the

ast.

33. Cicatricum . . ‚fratrum : i. e. may we be ashamed of the
evils we have brought on ourselves by the civil wars, and dread
a repetition of them.
