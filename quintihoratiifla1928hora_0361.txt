BOOK II.‘

SATIRE Ι.

This satire contains a dialogue between Horace and Treba-
tius, an eminent counsellor and a distinguished scholar. The
poet asks the advice of Trebatius, who counsels him to give up
the writing of satires, as calculated to render him odious ς and
to celebrate the achievements of Augustus. Horace refuses to
follow his advice, saying that he was not qualified for so
high asubject3 but that he must write something, and as he
liked satire, and as no one had any right to be displeased with
him sor satirizing vices, if he lived correctly himself, he should
go on writing in this way.

lives were often painted, and consecrated in a temple to some
god. Such a piece was called voti-va tabella.
