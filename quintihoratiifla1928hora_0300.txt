290 NOTES.

ODE ΧΙΙΙ.

This ode appears to have been written with a view to diverte
the mind of Pompeius Grosphus from some anxieties that
were at the time disturbing his peace, and to direct it to
the study of that true tranquillity which springs from well regu·-
lated passions, and is wholly independent of externa} circum-
stances.

ODE XIV.

Maecenas being sick, apprehendes] that his dissolution was at

hand. This sear he repeatedly expresses] in his complaints to .

Horace, who in this ode intreats him to forbear using such dis-
tressing language to him. He assures him that it will be im-
possible for him to survive his best friend and patron. He
shows, by a remarkable conformity in the events of their lives,
that their destinies are inseparably connected, particularly
in those accidents by which their lives had been endangered ς
and proposes that they should perform their sacrifices to the
gods in gratitude for their preservation.

It is probable that this was not the last sickness of Maecenas, ·
but that he recovered from it.

6. Quid moror . . . integer : ‘why should I, the other part, re-
mam, since I should not be equally dear to any other, nor in-
