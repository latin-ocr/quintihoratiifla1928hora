ODE XXII.

In this ode Horace makes known to Lyde his intention to
pass the day of Neptune’s feast at her house 3 away from the
noise and bustle of the celebration. He exhorts her to relax
her sobriety a little, and to bring forth her old wine.

3. Strenua .· Graece pro strenue, ‘promptly.’ As he writes,
he imagines himself already at her house, and urges her to put
off her gravity and bring forth her choice wine.

8. cessantem .· ‘waiting,’ for a call.

12. Cynthiae .· Diana.

13. -Summo carmine.- sc. cantabimus Venerem.

ODE XXIII.

This ode was addressed to Maecenas, when he was praefect
of Rome, and the whole weight and responsibility of the gov-
ernment rested on him. Horace intreats him to lay aside pub-
lic cares for a shorttime, and to attend a frugal entertainment
at his Sabine villa. ·

1. Tyrrhena.- pro Tyrrhenorum.

2. Non ante verso : ‘as yet unbroached) The ancients placed
their jars, or casks, upright3 and poured the wine out by turn-
ing them partially down, instead of drawing it out, as we do.

4. Baianus -· a choice unguent for the hair, expressed from a
kind of fruit commonly called myrobalanum.

. 8. Telegoni juga parricidae: ‘the hills of the parricide Tele-
gonus.’ Telegonus, son of Ulysses by Circe, having killed his
father without knowing him, went to Italy and built Tusculum

’ on a hill.

10. Molem : from his losty palace on the AEsquiline Hill,
which Horace calls molem, Maecenas could see the three cities
before mentioned.

13. Vices: ‘variety'3 ‘changes.’

16. Explicuere .· ‘have smoothed.'

17. Jam clarus . . . ignem.- i. e. now the bright constellation
Cepheus shows his fiery stars hitherto concealed. Cepheus, the
father of Andromeda, gave his name to a constellation near the
tail of the little bear. This constellation rises about the 9th of
July. It was therefore very hot when this invitation was given
to Maecenas.

18. Procyon .- a constellation so called from its rising just be-
fore the dog-star, Canicula—Furit : i. e. saevit oestu.

26. Curae, i. e. tu curas quis status deceat civitatem. It was
enough for Maecenas to look to the management of the affairs
of Rome, at that time containing about three milliens of inhabi-
