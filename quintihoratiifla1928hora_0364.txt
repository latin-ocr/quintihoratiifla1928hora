SATIRE ΠΙ.

This satire, written by way of dialogue‚ is intended to show
that all mankind are either madmen or fools. Horace had re-
tired into the country during the Saturnalia. Damasippus, a
stoic philosopher, pays him a visit, and in conversation blames
him for not writing and publishing something new, instead of
remaining idle, or retouching his former works. The discourse,
by an easy transition, turns upon Damasippus and his mode of
life. This leads to an explanation of the doctrines of the stoics‚
and a justification of their dogmas. The various passions, which
tyrannize over the human beart, are pourtrayed with inimitable
skill. The whole conversation is interspersed with moral re-
flections and useful instruction.

by scratching his head. See Book Ι. Sat. X. 71.
