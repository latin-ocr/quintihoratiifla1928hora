6. Ο. . . Pimple‘i dulcis: ‘O sweet Muse.’ Pimplea the
vocative case from Pimple‘is. Pimpla is a mountain i'n Mace-
donia with a fountain of the same name, sacred to the Muses,
who are therefore sometimes called PimpleIdes.

10. Hunc . . . sorores : ‘him it becomes you and your sister
Muses to consecrate to immortality on new harps, and in Les-
bian numbers! “Fidibus novis, carmine novo ; h. e. lyrico, quale

ODE XXII.

Mr. Sanadon says, that Horace was at an entertainment
where a dispute began to inflame some of the company already
heated with wine. Instead of attempting to restore peace by
grave advice and sober reasoning, he gaily proposed to drown
all disputes in a bumper3 which having succeeded, he wrote a
few lines on the occasion.

5. Vino et lucernis . . . discrepat: ‘how strangely abhorrentis

8. Cubito . . ,opressa .- this alludes to the custom of reclining

and the reply continues through the ode.

munera exigui pulveris cohibent te mensorem ‘maris et terrae

here given 3 viz. ‘ a small quantity of earth is sufficient for you
now, who lately stretched your mind over the vast expansa of
heaven, the wide extended ocean, and the land.’ But Dacier,
Gesner, and others think the meaning to be this: ‘the trifling

favour of a little dust to cover your body detains you from the =

Elysian fields 3’ alluding to the prevailing belief that the soul
