ODE XXX.

Plotius Numida had been three years with Augustus, en-
gaged in a war in Spain. On his return he was received· with
demonstrations of joy and thanksgiving by his friend Horace3
who, on this happy occasion, assembled the friends of Plotius,
and among them AElius Lamia, a school-fellow of Plotius, and
dearly beloved by him. This celebration was attended with
sacrifices, songs, and dances. ’

2. Placare: ‘to ,propitiatess This word may with propricty
be used, although Plotius had returned in¹ safety3 since his
friends were still bound to the performance of their vows3 and

would have reason to sear the resentment of the gods if this
should be neglected. '

5. Malta: sc. dividit oscula.

8. Non alio rege: it was customary among the Romans to
call the tutor or governor of a noblernan's children rex, or king.
Plotius and Lamia had not only past their boyhood together un·
der the same tutor, but had assumed the manly gown‚ toga vi-
ritis, at the same time.

9. Mutatae .· i. e. the toga praetexta, which was bordered with
purple, was laid aside for the toga virilis, which was of pure
white, and assumed at the age of seventeen years. This change
of the toga was attended with some solemnity, and usually be-
fore the images of the Lares.

10. Cressd .· fortunate and happy days were marked with
chalk, or a white stone ; and uulucky days with a. blaek mark
or a black stone. These were added up at the end of the year.

12. Morem in Saliam .· for Saliorum ; ‘after the manner of
the Salii! These were the twelve priests of Mars. See Lem-
priere.

13. Damalis: this was a woman of light character, notorious
for her love oswine.

14. Bassum: Bassus was a companion of Plotius, and a
hard drinker.

ODE XXXI.

The death of Cleopatra put an end to the war between Au-
gustus and Antony. This is one of several odes which Horace
wrote on that occasion. The character and tragical end of
Cleopatra are strikIngly represented. Her passions are in vio-
lent motion 3 her ambition is intoxication 3 her love is madness;
and her courage is despair. The soul of the poet seems kin-
dled with unusual fire.

2. Saliaribus . . . dapibus: The seasts of the Salii were oi the
most splendid and costly kind. The poet here probably means

to say that it is proper to prepare a lectisternium ; which was a
