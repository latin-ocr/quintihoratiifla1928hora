The Romans imagined that the virgins who had the honor of
singing the Secular Poem were soonest married.

ODE VI.

ln this beautiful ode the poet does not merely describe the
pleasures and charms of Spring. His object seems to be to in-
culcate a moral lesson. He would show by the rapid succes-
sion of the seasons, and the decay of all things in the vegetable
kingdom, that man himself is rapidly passing away3 and that
whatever he has to do in this life must be done quickly.

3. Mutat terra vices.- ‘the earth changes its appearance.’-—-
Ripas . . . proetereunt; ⁶ flow within their banks.’ The streams,
that had from the melting of snow and from the rains overflowed
their banks, have now subsided.

orateful da .'

s 13. Damym . . . lunae: ‘but the quickly gliding months repair
the losses made by the changing seasons.⁷ The ancients count-

17. Hodiernae . . . summae .· ‘to the sum of life attained this
da .’

{L Splendida . . . arbitria .- ‘ and Minos shall have passed his

ODE VII.

This ode is supposed to have been written either at the time
of the Saturnalia, when it was customary among the Romans
to send presents to their friends; or in return for something
valuable which the poet had received from Censorinus3 for
which he sent him these verses. So poets have usually paid
their debts of gratitudo.

1. Donarem . . . sodalibus .· ‘ I should take pleasure in giving
to my friends, O Censorinus, bowls and grateful vessels ot
brass?

5. Divite me . . . Scopas .· ‘ if I were rich in the works of art,
which either Parrhasius or Scopas produced.’ Parrhasius was
a celebrated painter, and Scopas a distinguished statuary.

7. Hic saxeo .· ⁴ Scopas in marble.’

8. Ponere .- ‘to represent!

12. Et pretium . .. muneri: ‘and can explain to you the
value of the gist3' that is, he can set forth the importance of
poetry kiln immortalizing the great and the good, which he goes
on to s ow.
