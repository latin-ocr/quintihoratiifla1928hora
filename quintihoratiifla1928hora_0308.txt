⁴ ODE IV.

Aster the civil wars were ended, Augustus turned his atten-
tion to the arts of peace. He particularly cherished learning
and learned men. In this ode Horace thanks the Muses for the
*favours they had bestowed on him, and especially for the friend-
ship and protection of Augustus, which he ascribes entirely to
their influence. He intimates that a love of poetry and elegant
literature had inspired his patron with nobler sentiments and
feelings than those of revenge and party strife. ⁷

2. Regina: i. e. O Calliope, regina Musarum, descende e
coele, age dic longum melos tibia. Calliope is here called queen
of the Muses, because she was their eldest sister, whence she
particularly presided over heroic poetry, and was attendant on
kings. Sanadon.

5. Auditis 12: ‘ do you hear her ‚⁹⁹ The poet seems already to
imagine his prayer granted, and that Calliope had descended
from heaven, and asks those about him if they hear her.

9. Me.- the construction is, fabulosae palumbes temere ηουᾶ
fronde me pue-rum, δια- Vulture: Vultur, or Vulturnus, was a
mountain of Apulia, which extended into Lucania. The part of

liae ; 4 beyond the bounds of my native Apulia.'

13. Mirum . . . Acherontiae: ‘which was matter of astonish-
ment to all, who inhabit the town of losty Acherontia.' This
was a small town on the top of a high hill, which the poet calls
nidus, ‘ a bird’s nest‚’ from its situation.
