ODE VII.

A festival was observed with much religious pomp by the
Roman ladies on the first of March, in memory of the day on
which the Sabine women reconciled, and made peace between
the Sabines and their husbands, who had seized them. On this
day too they had dedicated a temple to Juno, in which they an-
nually offered sacrifices to that goddess. While the ladies were
engaged in their offerings to J un0‚ their husbands sacrificed to
Janus. Aster these religious services were over, the ladies re-
ceived presents from their husbands and other friends, as an
acknowledgment of the favour conferred by their happy media-
tion. The Calends of March were called Matronalia, or Ma-
tronales Feriae.

We may suppose that .Maecenas, in a visit to the poet early
on the Calends of March, had expressed some surprise at finding
him employed in preparations sor a domestic feast, as Horace
was not a married man. This ode was written in consequence,
in which Horacesinforms him of the reason, and invites him to
be present at the entertainment.

1. Martiis . . . lingum : the construction is, O MaecenaS, docte
sermones utriusque linguae, mira-ris quid ego coelebs agam kalen-
dis Martiis, quid flores velint, et acerra plena thuris, carboque
positus in vivo cespite.

5. Docte . . . linguae .- ‘learned in both Greek and Latin.'
This means no more than a complimentary salutation3 as vir
eruditissime.

7. Libero.- the poet here ascribes his preservation to Bac-
chus 3 whereas in Book II. Ode XIV. 28, he attributes the same
kind office to Faunus. As both these divinities were supposed
to have poets under their protection, Dacier thinks it may be
the same god under different names3 and that a goat was of-
fered to him under the name of Bacchus, and a sheep when
he was called Faunus.

11. Institutae: i. e. coeptae.

13. Amici sospitis .· sc. in gratiam3 i. e. ob amicum sospitem.

15. Perfer in lucem : ⁴ continue till daybreak.’

17. Mitte civiles : Maecenas, in the absence of Augustus, had
the government of Rome. ἡ

18. Daci Cotisonis .· CotIso was king of the Daci, or Getae.
He had made inroads into the Roman territory3 but was re-
pulsed by Lentulus.

. 21. Servit . . . Cantaber .- the war in Spain continued more

thffi twdo hundred years before the Cantabrians were perfectly
su ue .
