ODE XXV.

Glycera, a lady of great beauty, and a friend of Horace,
being about to give an entertainment at her house, had in-
vited him to attend it. We may suppose Horace, with his
answer, to have sent this little neat and beautiful invocation to
the goddess of beauty, requesting her to smile on the scene.

4. AEdem .· It was customary with the Romans to have a part
of their mansion fitted up as a kind of chapel, in which were
kept the images of their household godS, to whom at feasts
they offered libations.

ODE XXVI.

Augustus built a temple to Apollo within his palace cn mount
Palatine3 and when it was consecrated, most of the eminent
poets of the age wrote something upon the occasion. It is sup-
posed that Horace wrote this ode for that solemn ceremony, at
the request of the emperor.

1. Quid .. . . vates .· ⁶ what does the poet ask of Apollo, to
whom this day a temple is dedicated? ’—- Vates, i. e. ego poet-2.
He repeats the question, ‘ what does he pray for? ' to give
force to the interrogation. Because he is not about to ask for
those things which are usually most desired.

panla.
