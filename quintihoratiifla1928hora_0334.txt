324 NOTES.

Lucani& Lucania was cooler than Calabria, and suited to sum-
mer pasturage. ⁷

29. Nec ut . . . moenia : i. e. nor that my Sabine villa, built
of white marble, may extend to the walls of Tusculum, far
above it. Tusculum was built by Telegonus, the son of Circe ;
hence Circoea moenia. It was more than twenty miles from
Horace's country seat.

33. Avarus . . . premam :¹ ‘I may bury in the earth, like ava-
ricious old Chremes.’ This is a character in a play of Te-
rence.

34. Discinctus . . . nepos .- ‘or prodigal may squander away like
a spendthrist.’ The Romans tied up their gowns with a girdle
when they were at work, and wished to be free from incum-
brance 3 hence the phrase accingere ad opus. But when un-
employed they suffered them to fiow loosely 3 hence discinctus
and dissolutus signify an effeminate and negligent person—Ne-
pos -· this word, which originally signified a grandson, from the
too great indulgence generally shown by grandfathers, and the
ruin that ensued, became the common term for ‘ spendthrist.’

q EPODE II.

This epode is a satire upon avarice. The poet introduces
Alfius, a covetous old usurer, (who was satisfied of the necessity
of renouncing his mode of life, and who had resolved on re·
tiring from the city‚) as recounting the blessings and the charms
of a country life. After he has called in all his money, and by
way of soliloquy gone through with the inimitable description of
rural felicity contained in this poem, his ruling passion comes
over him too strongly to be resisted, and he again lets his
money out on interest.

4. Foenorc .· ‘money transactions.' Foenus usually signifies
the interest of money, which, by the laws of the Twelve TableS,
must not exceed one per centum a month.

7. Forum .- ‘courts of law.’

12. Inserit: ‘he ingrasts.'

13. Mugientium: sc. boum. ,

20. Certantem . . . purpuroe : ‘ the grape vying with purple.'

.· 22. Tutor finium .· ‘ the tutelary god of boundaries.’

’ 24. In tenaci gramine .· ‘on a bed of grass) By tenaci we
may understand ‘ strong-rooted ’ς ‘not easily pulled up by the
roots.' It is here used rather as an expletive word,

28. Quod : ‘ which combination of sounds.’

31. Malui cane .· i. e. with a numerous pack of hounds3 as
multo milite.

33. amite : i. e. a pole around which the nets were fastened.

35. advenam.- i. e. a visiter, migrating in the winter to the
warm climate of Italy.

41. Perusta solibus : ‘sun-burnt.’
