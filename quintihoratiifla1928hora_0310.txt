300 NOTES. '

ODE V. ,

This ode seems to have been written in honour of Augustus.
It sets forth his achievements and represents him as the guar-r
dian god of the Roman people.

1. Coelo . . . regnare : ‘ we have been accustomed to beli—eve·
that Jove reigns in heaven from hearing him thunder there.'

2. Praesens divus : ‘a god upon earth? i. e. so Augustus by
his conquests and his services to his country shall be hailed as
a visible divinity. Presens has this signification, and not pro-
pitius,savens‚ as some have supposed.

4. Persis.- Itis said that Phraates, king of the Parthians, after
being restored to his throne, was so alarmed merely at the re-
port that Augustus was about to make war upon him, that he
voluntarily sent an embassy to him and offered to restore the.
military standards that had been lost several years before at
the defeat of Crassus. The Parthians are here meant by Per-
sis. Augustus did not in reality subdue either the Britons or
Parthians, but the people submitted to the authority of his

name. See Book Ι. Ode XXI. 3. note.
· 5. Milesne . . . vixit.- i. e. “AEIiles Crassi, α Parthis ignomi-
ηἰοεά ,εἶαῗε affl’pcti, potuitne captivus cum conjuge alienigena vi-
vere? ' aec .

7. Proh curia . . . mores: ⁶ ah degenerate senate, and corrupt
manners ! '

10. anciliorum.- i. e. the twelve sacred shields preserved by
the Salii, as the pledges of empire, one of which was supposed
to have dropped from heaven.--Togoe .· the toga was considered
as the distinguishing mark of a Roman.

13. Reguli : Regulus, being taken captive by the Carthagini·
ans, was sent to Rome on parole of honour, to treat of an ex-
change of prisoners. Instead of advising this measure, by
which he would himself have been restored to his, country, he
dissuaded the senate from it, as against their interest to ex-
change the young and vigorous Carthaginians for the less effi-
cient Romans. He returned and surrendered himself to his
enemies 3 who, being enraged at his conduct, put him to death
by the most cruel tortures.

15. Ec exemplo . . . oevum : ‘and from an example bringi-ng

mischief to the coming age)
17. Immiserabilis : “pro immiseram ,· i. e. si redimeretur.”

Doer.

23, Et arva . . . nostro .· ‘ and I saw the fields, which we had
laid waste by war, now cultivated) Regulus had conquered
the Carthaginians and laid waste their territory almost to the
walls of their city, before the shameful defeat which the indo-

lence of his soldiers brought upon him.
38. Pacem duello miscuit.- ‘ he consounds peace with war,’ by
