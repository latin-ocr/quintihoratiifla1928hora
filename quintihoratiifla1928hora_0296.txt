ODE VII.

Licinius Varro Murena, the brother of Proculeius Varro Mu·
rena, mentioned in Ode II. 5. of this Book, sor his parental af-
fection ard generosity towards his brotherS, was a young man
of a restless, ardent, and ambitious spirit. Horace, knowing his
character, and wishing to preserve him from the evils to which
his fearless and aspiring views exposed him, addressed this ode
to him, containing much sound wisdorn, and some excellent
rules and maxims for life. But Licinius could not be governed
by them. Having been detected in forming a conspiracy
against Augustus, he suffered the fatal consequences of his
rashness. For all the interest which his brother Proculeius and
Maecenas, who married his sister Terentia, were able to exert,
could not save him.

13. Sperat infestis : sc. rebus ; ‘in adversity hopes.’

17. Non . . . sic erit: ‘if things go wrong now, it will not be

ODE VIII.

Quinctius Hirpinus was a man of great wealth, and of an
anxious and timid character. He made himself unhappy by
dreading changes and civil commotions, which might end-anger
his possessions. Horace offers to him, in this beautiful ode,
the same kind of consolation which he frequently gives, to oth-
ers in trouble. He exhorts them not to be anxious about futuri-
ty3 since life is too short to have any portion of it wasted in
unavailing anxieties. Old age and infirmities will soon deprive
them of the power of enjoying the blessings they possess. He
recommends, therefore, that they should make the most of
present enjoyments, without troubling their thoughts about the
things beyond their reach or control.
