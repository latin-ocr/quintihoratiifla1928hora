ODE XIV.

A deep feeling *of gratitude, as well as a strong persona}
attachment to AugustuS, breaks out and shows itself on almost
every occasion, where our poet can with propriety indulge in his
favourite theme. He devotes this whole ode to the praises of
his glorious reign and princely virtues. The immediate occa-
sion of the ode was probably the closing of the gates of the
temple of J anus.

2. Increpuit lyra.- this expression has been variously explain—
ed 3 but Doering's interpretation seems to be the most natural
and the most Classical. He joins lyra with 'loqui; thus, Me
volentem lyra coqui (canere) proelia et victas urbes Phoebus in·
crepuit (graviter admonuit), ne darem parva vela per Tyrrhenam
aequor.

6. Et signa.- the military standards‚ restored by Phraates to
AugustuS, were carried to the Capitol, i. e. the temple of Jupiter
Capitolinus. See Book I. Ode XXI. 3. note.

9. Janum Quirini.- the temple of J anus was built by Romu·
lus3 hence Horace calls it Janum Quirini, or Romulus’ Janus.
The gates of this temple were always open, except in time of
peace. They had been only twice shut before the reign of
Augustus, and three times during that period. This was the
third time—Ordinem: thus3 et injecit sroena licentiae evaganti
extra rectum ordinem.

21. Non.- sc. populi.

22. Edicta . . . Julia .- i. e. the laws which Augustus imposed
on vanquished nations. He belonged to the Julian family.

25. Profestis luci-bus.- i. e. common dayS, before the festi·

vals.
