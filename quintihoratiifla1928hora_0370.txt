SATIRE V.

This satire contains a dialogus between Ulysses and Tire-

sias, a famous blind prophet. Homer represents Ulysses as
'descending to the infernal regions to consult Tiresias on the
events of his voyage. On his return to Ithaca, Ulysses finds
that Penelope’s suitors had plundered and wasted his property.
As the predictions of Tiresias had so far proved true, Ulysses
‘is here represented as having raised his spirit to consult him
further, as to the manner of repairing his fortune. This satire
contains the advice of the soothsayer.
