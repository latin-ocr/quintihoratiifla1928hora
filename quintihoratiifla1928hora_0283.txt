ODE XX.

Quinctilius Varus, a distinguished poet of Cremona, was the
intimate and mutual friend of Horace and Virgil, but perhaps
endeared to no one more than to the latter. He died in the
seven hundred and twenty-ninth year of Rome. The death of
Varus was most deeply felt by Virgil, to whom this ode is ad-
dressed by way of condolence.

2. Praecipe . . . Melpomene : ‘ O Melpomene, teach me mourn-
ful strains.’ Horace, with much propriety, invokes the Muse
of Tragedy to aid him in the tribute he is about to pay to
the worth of their lamented friend3 for whom no measure of
grief seemed to be excessive.

ll. Non ita . . . deos : i. e. you request the gods to restore you
Quinctilius, who was not given you on the condition that he
was not to be taken away.

13. Quod si . . .fidem.· ‘ but though more sweetly than Thra-
cian Orpheus, you tune the lyre listened to by trees.’

14. Arboribus; in the dative case, aS, neque cernitur ulli.-
Adam’s Lat. Gram. R. xxviii. Obs. 2.

17. Non lenis . . . recludere : ‘ not easily induced by prayers
to open the path back into life again! “Fata recludere, h. e. '
viam ex Orco in vitam redituris occlusam recludere.” Doering.

ODE XXI.

Lucius AElius Lamia, a poet of considerable reputation, and a
friend of Horace, had in the civil dissensions joined the repub-
licans. After the downfall of his party, he became despondent,
and thought the commonwealth was going to ruin. It seems ῒο»
be the design of this ode to raise the drooping spirits of Lamia,
and to divert his thoughts to poetry and literature.

1. Masis anricus.- i. e. if the Muses do but smile on me, Ι
shall banish all sear and melancholy. ’

3. Quis . . . securus .· ‘ wholly indifferent by whom the king
of the frozen regions, under the north pole, may be feared, or
what may terrify Teridates.’—Teridaten .- In the year of Rome
719, the Parthians expelled their king Phraates for his cruelty,
and placed Teridates on his throne. But about five years after,
Phraates was restored to his dominions by the assistance of the<-
Parthians. Teridates fied to Augustus, and carried with him
the son of Phraates. A few years after, Phraates sent an ern-⁴
bassy to Rome, with an offer of restoring the Roman Eagles,
which had been taken at the defeat of Crassus, if Augustus
would restore his son and Teridates to him. While this negocia-
tion was pending, this ode was written. What cause Teridates
had for being alarmed we can imagine. The son was restored,
but Tiridates was not given up· ’
