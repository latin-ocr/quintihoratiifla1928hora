ODE XIII.

It is supposed that Horace addressed this ode to Marlc
Antony, at the time he was ensnared by the love of Cleopatra·⁷
and was meditating an expedition with her against Italy, that
he might make her mistress of the Roman empire, to dissuade
him from that desperate enterprise. Torrentius says, that he
saw an ancient manuscript, in which the title of this ode was,
Ad Alexandrum Paridem. And there is little doubt but a pa-
rallel is here intended between Paris and Antony 3 each of
whom embarked for his own country with a foreign queen, to
the ruin of himself and those connected with him.

1. Pastor: Paris, in consequence of his mother's dream, that
he would be the destruction of Troy and of Priam's house, was
sent away as soon as he was born, and committed to a shepherd
on mount Ida, to be brought up to that mode of life, in igno-
rance of his parentage. After he was received and acknow-
ledged at court, he was frequently called Pastor Dardanus,
‘the Trojan Shepherd.’

2. Perfidus: Paris was a visitor at the palace of Menelaus, at
the time he committed the treacherous and infamous violation
of hospitality, which gained him this epithet.

5. Mala . . . avi: ‘with inauspicious omen.’ The Romans
frequently took their omens from birds.

7. Conjurala : the Grecian princes assembled with their forces
at Aulis, where they bound themselves by an oath not to re·-
turn till they had destroyed the kingdom of Priam, and avenged
the insult offered to their nation.
