ODE X.

Horace, having narrowly escaped with his life, from the fall
of a tree whilst he was walking on his farm, breaks out with
dgeadfiss imprecations upon the trec and the person who plant-
e it.

He is naturally led to reflect on the dangers to which we
are at all times exposed, and against which it is impossible to
be sufficiently guarded. His thoughts are turned to the world
of spirits, to which he came so near being sent unawares. And
by way of compliment to lyric poetry, he represents the shades,
and even Cerberus and the Furies‚ as overpowered by the mu-

1. Ille . . . pagi .· the construction is, Quicunque primum po-

countr .’ -

26. {lenius .- ‘in loftier strains.’

29. Utrumque .· each, both Alcaeus and Sappho.

30. Sed magis . . . vulgus : ‘but the crowd, pressing each
other’s shouklers, listen with more willing ear to, accounts of

ODE XI.

The shortness of life and the inevitable event of death are
very feelingly set forth in this ode. But the argument and the
inference are, as usual with our poet, employed to enforce the
