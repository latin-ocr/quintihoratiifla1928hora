EPISTLE IX.

This is a letter of introduction and commendation to Tiberius
'Claudius Nero in behalf of Septimius, the poet’s particular
friend. The great delicacy necessary on such an occasion is
manifestly felt by Horace, who pleads the importunity of his
friend, ⁴as an excuse for what he doeS‚ with modesty and seem-
ing reluctance.

l. Septimius . . . facias .· ‘ O Claudius, Septimius alone sor-
:ooth knows how high Ι stand in your esteem.’

ence I have with you much better than Ι (10 myseli.

EPISTLE X.

There are few persons insensible to the pleasures of tho·
country. In Horace this feeling became a kind of passion3
and the praises he bestows in this epistle on a country life and·
on contentinent with one’s lot, are pleasing and instructive.

simple and natural enjoyrnents of the country.
