ODE VIII.

This ode is an encomium upon Lollius, who is represented as
possessing the most exalted virtues. Lollius little deserved this
praise. But his hypocrisy, for a long time, completely conceal·
ed his real character, not only from Horace, but from others,
{nd even from Augustus. But he was afterwards rightly un-

erstood.

sorte, ut verba interitura, qaae ego natus ad Aufidum sonantem
longe loquor, socianda chordis per artes non ante vulgatas. ‘ Do
not think, Ο Lollius,’ &a

5. Non si . . . Camoenoe: ‘although Homer holds the first
rank among poets, Pindar and Simonides are not therefore with-
out their merit 3 the menacing lines of Alcaeus, and the grave and
majestic muse of Stesichorus are still held in remembrance.’

live, which were tuned to the lyre of the AEolian maid,' Sappho.

ne non sola arsit comptos crines adulteri, et aarum, &a

18. Non semel Ilios: Troy was besieged by Hercules, and by
the Amazons, before it was by the Greeks.

30. Celata: i. e. not celebrated by poets and historians.

39. Non unius anni: the meaning is, that the services of
Lollius were not confined to the year of his consulship, but that
his influence was long felt with the wise and good who were
magistrates aster him.

42. Dona nocentium: ‘the bribes of those who wished to
corrupt him.’
