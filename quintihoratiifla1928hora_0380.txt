370· NOTES.

EPISTLE XI.

It ‘is not known who Bullatius wast, to whom this letter was
-addressed. But he is supposed to have retired to Asia when
the last quarrel was breaking out between Augustus and An-
·tony, that he might not again behold the horrors of a civil war.
When it was ended, our poet invites him to return to Rome3
and gives such excellent maxims as might be useful to a person
‘too much inclined to despondency. Sanadon.

1. Quid . . . Lesbos : ‘how does Chios appear to yon, and
rfamed Lesbos, Ο Bullatius Ρ ’

5. Attalicis una .· ‘ one of the cities ruled by Attalus?

7. Desertior . . . vicus: se. nunc; i. e. though now but a de-
:serted village3 it was once a very celebrated city.

17. *Incolumi . . . solstitio .· ‘ to a sound mind Rhodes and fair
.Mitylene are about the same, as a great coat in summer?

21. Romae: i. e. when you are at Rome, let Samos, Chios,
-and Rhodes be praised.

25. Nam si . . . aufert .· ‘ for if reason and prudence only, and
·no situation, however commanding its prospect over the ex-
,panded-ocean, can dispel our cares.'

EPISTLE XII.

This epistle is addressed to the same person to whom Horace
addressed the XXIVth Ode of the Ist Book. He there rallies
Iccius with some humour on turning soldier, and abandoning his
{literary and philosophical pursuits. He now ridicules his love
vof money, blended with philosophical pursuits.

7. In medio positorum: ‘in the midst of abundance spread
:vout'before you.’

12. Miramur si.- i. e. can we wonder that the fields and
-crops of Democritus became the prey of flocks‚ while his mind
was searehin‘g for the hidden causes of things3 when you, ι
amidst so corrupt an age, where the love of gain spreads like*
a contagion, withdraw your mind from all low inquiries, and

EPISTLE XIII.

It seems our poet had intrusted several rolls of his writings,
volumina, to his friend Vinius AseHa, to be carried to Augus-
tus. But he was anxious that they should be presented at a
proper time, when he might be unemployed by more weighty
conc-ems 3 and that they should not, through too much zeal on
‘the part of his friend, be urged upon the emperour at an un-

‚seasonable time or place.
2. Signata: he wished them to be delivered-scaled, that they
