272 NOTES.

ODE XVIII.

This is a hymn of praise and thanksgiving to Apollo and
Diana, to be sung by a choir of twenty-seven young men, and
another choir of the same number of young virgins, on a day
consecrated to the worship of these tutelary divinities. The
poet seems to take the part of a priest of Apollo, and to dictate
to each choir what to sing.

1. Tenerae . . . virgines .- the choir of virgins is first exhorted
to sing the praises of Diana.

2. Intonsum . . . Cynthium : then the choir of young men is
exhorted to sing the praises of Apollo.

3. Latonamque . Jovi: ‘ Sing too Latona, the mother of
both, supremely loved by almighty Jove.'

5. Loetam: sc. Dianam ‘delightingin.'

9. Tempe : to this delightful vale Apollo retired aster he slew
the serpent Python.

11. Ins-ignemque . . . lyrci : ‘ and the shoulder os Apollo,
graced with his quiver and the lyre received from his brother?
Mercury, t'ne inventor of the lyre, presented it to Apollo.

13. Hie.- Apollo} motus vestrci prece aget bellum, &c

ODE XIX.

In this elegant and beautiful ode, Horace describes to his
friend Fuscus, the rhetorician, the advantages of uprightness
of character and purity of life. These are the best defence‚ and
afford the greatest security a man can have.

ll· ⁹Integer . . . purus .· ‘ a man of upright life, and free from
gui t.

5. Syrtes . . . aestuosas .- the poet does not here speak of the
marine Syrtes, but the sandy deserts of Africa 3 where the scorch-
ing heat of the sun renders the region at times impassable.
AEstuosas may refer to the beat of the sands, from aestus; or
to the fluctuating nature of the quicksands‚ which are driven
about by the wind in billows, like water. The word Syrtes
comes from σύρειν, ‘ to drag, or sweep along.’

7. Fabulosus .- the river Hydaspes is so called from the fabu-
lous reports of its washing gold and gems along with its water.

8. Lambit .· for alluit.

15. Jubae tellus: Mauritania, which was subject to J uba.

fl} Pigris . . . campis .· he first speaks of the frigid zone, then
o t e torrid.

22. Terret domibus negaui: the ancients entertained the opin-
ion, that the torrid zone was uninhaffltable, on account of the
beat, which errour modern experience has corrected.
