THE ART OF POETRY.

Tnnsr: remarks upon the art of poetry were probably de-
signed as the third epistle of the second book, and addressed
to Lucius Piso and his two sons. Horace did not pretend to
give a complete treatise upon the art of poetry3 but to throw
out such hints upon the leading topics of the subject, as the na-
ture of an epistle would allow. He has therefore observed no
particular method or order in discussing the subject3 nor been
at the trouble of making any preamble. He begins at once
with the most essential, necessary, and important precept, which
is unity and simplicity of design.
