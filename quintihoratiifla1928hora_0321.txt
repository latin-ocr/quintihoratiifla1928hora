ODE XXI.

There is a difficulty in comprehending the meaning of this
ode fully3 as the person addressed under the name of Galatea
is not known. Nor are the circumstances or object of the con-
templated voyage understood.

1. Impios . . . ab ortu : the drist of these twelve lines seems
to be this: May all those omens, which are usually esteemed
inauspicious by persons about to commence a journey, happen
to the wicked 3 but may those be ⁴favourable which attend the
departure of her for whose safety I am anxious—Impios . . .
ducat: ‘may the cry of an ill-omened bird attend the guilty.'
It is not certain what kind of bird is meant by parra.

5. Rumpat: ‘thwart'3 ‘interrupt.'

6. Si per . . . mannos: ‘if, shooting across the road like an
arrow, it has frightened the horses.’—Mauuos .· small, swist
homes, or nags.

7. Ego cui . . . ab ortu .· the construction is, Providus auspex
prece suscitabo 1111, cui ego timebo, oscinem corvum ab ortu solis,
antequam avis divina imminentiam imbrium repetat stantes pa-
ludes—Divina : ‘knowing beforehand.' Birds which gave
omens by their singing were called oscines .· those that gave
them by their flight were called praepetes, or alites. When the
crow or raven repaired to the margin of a lake to bathe itself
in the water, this was thought to forebode a storm 3 and the voice
of this bird, when heard from the east, was considered a good
omen.

15. Loevus . . . picus : ⁴ the ill-hoding woodpecker.’

19. Novi .· ‘know by experience.'-Et quid . . . Iapyx.- ‘ and
how deceitful is the serene Iapyx.’

24. Verbere: sc. fluctuum: ‘ with the lashing surge!

28. Palluit audam : i. e. she, who had dared to trust herself
to the back of a bun, now grew pale at the sight of sea-mon-
sters. This is an allusion to the fable of Jupiter and Europa.

31. Nocte sublustri : ‘by star-light)

35. Pietas: ‘filial affection?

41. Porta . . . eburnei : true dreams were said to pass through
a gate of horn ; false dreams, through one of ivory.

55. Speciosa .· ‘ while my comeliness remains?

57. Vilis Europe, . . . quid mori cessas: she imagines her
angry father to upbraid her in these words, which continue to
pellex, in the 66th verse.
² 61. Acuta leto .· ‘ sufficiently sharp to kill you.⁸²

68. Filius.- Cupid.

69. ,abstineto . . . irarum .· ‘ abstain from your anger? -By
a Greek construction. , See Lat. Gram. Rule XVI. obs. 1.
