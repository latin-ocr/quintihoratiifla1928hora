EPODES.

As there have been various conjectures respecting the mean-
ing and derivation of the title of this Book, it maj,⁷ be well for
the reader to peruse the following remarks of Doering upon the
subject. “ De inscriptione hujus libri Epidau, sive ab Horatio,
sive a Grammatico aliquo, profecta, unde illa petita fuerit, et
quo sensu accipienda sit, non amplius ambigi potest. Scilicet
Iamborum inventor, Archilochus, ejusmodi quoque Iamborum
genus invenisse dicitur, quos ἐπῳδοὺς appellaret, quia in illis, ut
Diomedes ait, versuum parles (h. e. versus breviores) legitimis
et integris versibus ἒπάδανεναι, h. e. aceinuntur, vel, ut H ephaestion
docet, ἴτων μεγάλῳ στίχῳ περιττὸν τι impignorata. J am verb cum ipse
Horatius Archilochi se imitatorem profiteatur, hic liber Epo-
don ejus juvenilia inprimis et maledicentiora carmina contineat.”
It is therefore a name adopted from Archilochus.

EPODE Ι.

This epode was written on the eve of the great engagement be-
tween Augustus on one side, and Antony with Cleopatra's sorces
and fieet on the other. Maecenas had refused to have Horace
accompany him on this expedition, as he had been accustomed
to do on similar occasions. The poet feels evidently hurt by
the refusal. He expresses his anxiety and deep concern.

1. Ibis . . . propugnacula .· ‘you will then venture, Ο my friend
Maecenas, with light Liburnian gallies, amidst the lofty hulwarks
of Antony’s ships.’ <The fleet of Augustus was composed, in a
great measure, of these light gallies. See Book I. Ode XXXI.
30. note.

5. Quid ‘nos . . . gravis .· ‘ and what shall I do, to whom life
is delightful while you survive, but to whom it would be a bur-.
den, were you taken away.’ ' ⁴

7. Jussz‘: sc. ate.

9. Hunc laborem: i. e. the danger of this campaign.

21. Ut adsit: ‘although she were with them.' We find ut
used in this way for licet by other writers also.

25. Ut juvencis . . . meis.- by. Hypallage, for ut plures juvenci
illigati meis aratris nitantur. ⁷

27. Calabris . . . Lucana mutet: by Hypallage, for Calabra
