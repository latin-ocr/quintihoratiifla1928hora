might not be the subject of impertinent curiosity to the cour-
tiers.

8. Asina: : Horace humourously reminds Asella not to stum-
ble awkwardly with them into Caesar’s presence, lest the cour-
tiers should make a joke of him, and of his sirname, which sig-
nified α little ass,

12. Sub am .· ‘ under your arm.'

14. Ut . . . lanae -· ‘ as drunken Pyrrhia carries her bottoms of
stolen yarn.’ A character in a comedy by Titinnius.

EPISTLE XIV.

This epistle is addressed by Horace to his steward in the
country, showing him the folly of preferring a life in the city
to one in the country. He says this preference arises from in-
constancy of mind, and a love of change.

2. Quem . . . patres : ⁶ which, though you despise it, was for-
merly possessed by five familias, and was wont to send five
good senators to Varia) This estate was within the jurisdic-
tion of Varia, where the most respectable commoners convened
to consult on public affairs.

10. Ego .· sc.. dico. ¹

14. Tu mediastinus .- ‘ you when a slave of the lowest rank)

28. Disjunctum .- ‘ when unyoked)

33. Sed . , . ludum: ⁴ but not to set bounds to indulgence.’

41. Calo.- this means a slave of the lowest order, that is em-
ployed in bringing wood and water, and performing other simi-
> lar offices in a family.

EPISTLE XV.

Antonius Musa, physician to Augustus, had recommended
the cold bath to Horace, who practised cold bathing in Clusium
and Gabii. But finding the winter too severe, he resolved to
go to some warmer climate and try sea-bathing. For this rea-
son he writes to his friend Numenius Vala, who had been using
the baths at Velia and salernum, to give him some account of
the climate, people, accommodations, &c- The beginning of
this epistle is very much transposed and confused. We must
look as far as the twenty-ibuith verse before we can get the
natural arrangement of the thoughts.

’ 1. Qaae sit hiems: before taking in this, it seems necessary
to bring in the twenty-fourth verse: Par est te scribere, ac
7103 accredere tibi, quw, sit hiems Velm> ,· i. e. you must write to
nie, Vala, what kind of winter you have at Velia, and what the
climate of salernum 3 what is the character of the inhabitants,
and how the roads are 3 for Antonius Musa assures me that the
waters of Baiae are useless to me.

3. illis: i. e. to the people at Baiae.
