ODE XII.

Horace in his youth had been much in -love with Lyce, a
beautiful, but proud girl, who did not reciprocate his passion.
He now takes occasion to insult her by triumphing over her
faded charms, and exulting at the ravages which time has
made upon her beauty. It would have been well for the reputa-
tion of the poet, if this ode had not been written.

This was an island in the AEgean sea, from which choice silks
were brought.

Cynarass This was another beautiful young woman with whom
Horace, in his addresses, was more successfuL-—Et artium . . .
facies· .· ‘and a face possessing every pleasing charm?

ODE XIII.

In the introduction to the third ode of this book it is men-
tioned, that Augustus had desired Horace to write in honor of
the conquests achieved by Drusus and Tiberius. In that ode
the praises of Drusus are chiefly celebrated3 in this, those of
Tiberius. But the beginning is employed in ascribing the
success of the two brothers to the wisdom and prudence of
Augustus; instead of coming at once to the eulogium of the
immediate agents.

7. Quem . . . posses.- ‘whom the Vindelici, hitherto free from-
the Roman laws, have lately felt, and learned what you can do
m war.
