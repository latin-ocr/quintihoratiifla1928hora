EPISTLE XVI.

We may suppose that Quinctius had rallied Horace on the
extent and magnificence of his country-seat, that had chal-ms
sufficient to detaiu him so long from Rome. The poet, aster
giving a description of his residem-e, falls into some moral re-
flections which may have a bearing on' the character of Quinc-
tius, and be an offset to what he had before written to Horace.

1. Ne perconteris . . . ulmo: ‘that you may not have the
trouble of inquiring, most excellent Quinctius, whether my
farm supplies its owner with grain, or enriches him with olives,
frusts, pastui-age, or vines covering the elms.’

4. Loquar-iter: ‘ ait-full length)

14. Irfirmo . . . alvo.- ‘and excellent for disorders of the
head and the stomach) “

17. Quod audis : ‘ what you have the reputation« of being.’

19. Sed vereor . . . beatum .· ‘ but Ifear that you rely more on
the judgmeut of others about yourselfi than you oo on your
own; and that you think a man may be happy without being
wise and good?

41. consulta potrum .· ‘the decrees of tlie senate!

49. Renuit negat atque Sabellus: ‘ that Ι object to and deny.'
Horace pleasantly styles himself Sabaeas, inasmuch as country
people allow their slaves to take greater liberty than they have
in the city. 'The situation of atque after neg-(1⁴⁴. is unusual and
forced ς and it has given occasion to various conjectures.

60. Labra movet: i. e. after addressing Janus οι· Apollo with
a loud voice, he whispers his prayer to taverna, sear-ing some
fone else will hear him. Laverna was the protectress of thn‘ueven
md imposters. v *o ·

EPISTLE XVII.

Horace ¹gives his young friend Scaeva some instructions re-
speeting his conduc-t at court; that he may preserve his integ-
rity, and pass witli honour and happiness through that scene of
'danger and temptation. He shows that an active life, the life

· os a man determined to desei-ve and secure the favour and es-

teem of the great by his own merit, is infinitely more honour-
able than alife spent in indolence, without emulation or am-
bition. He cautious him against asking favours.
