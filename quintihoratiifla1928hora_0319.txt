ODE XVIII.

In this ode Horace inveighs against luxury and extravagance
as the prevailing vices of the age. The ode may be considered
as consisting of three parts. In the first, the poet exposes the
licentious enormities of the age 3 in the second, he shows
their causes3 and in the third, points out their proper reme-
dies. .

l. Intactis . . . caput .· the construction is, Licet occupes omne
Tyrrhenum et Apulicum mare tuis caementis, opulentior intactis
thesauris Arabum et divitis Indice, tamen si dira Necessitas figit
adamantinos clavos summis verticibus, non expedies animum me-

influence in securing the happiness of marriage among the
Scythians3 a virtuous education, an attachment of wives to
their husbands, their horror of conjugal infidelity, and the
severity of their laws in punishing that crime with death.

27. Si quoeret . . . postgenitis: ‘if he wishes to have written
beneath his statues, Father of his country, let him dare to curb

the overwhelming spirit of licentiousness, and he will become
renowned to posterity.’

30. Quatenus: ‘in as much as ' ς ‘ since?

42. Magnum . . . opprobrium: i. e. what do laws avail if

45. Vel ‘nos in Capitolium .· The poet sayS, if we really wish
to put an end to this lusury and vice, and to return to our
primitive simplicsty, let us either carry our superfluous wealth
